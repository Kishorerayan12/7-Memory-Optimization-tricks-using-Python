00:02:54,537 --> 00:02:57,455
<i>In the last year of the World War,
the Tomainian nation began to weaken.</i>

2
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,457
<i>Behind her lines
revolution had broken out.</i>

3
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:01,459
<i>Her diplomats were frantically
suing for peace...</i>

4
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:03,712
<i>while at the front
Tomainia's army fought on...</i>

5
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:05,714
<i>confident its war machine
was invincible...</i>

6
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:08,466
<i>confident its war machine
would smash the enemy's lines.</i>

7
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:11,469
<i>Big Bertha, a cannon that could
hurl a projectile a hundred miles...</i>

8
00:03:11,554 --> 00:03:14,139
<i>was this day to make
its first appearance on the Western Front...</i>

9
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:16,891
<i>was this day to strike terror
into the hearts of the enemy.</i>

10
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:21,312
<i>Seventy-five miles away was her target,
the cathedral of Notre Dame.</i>

11
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:27,027
Range: 95,452!

12
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:29,571
- Range: 95,452!
- Yes, sir!

13
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:32,198
- Stand clear!
- Fire!

14
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:51,217
Hey!
Stand by your trigger.

15
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:52,844
Yes, sir.

16
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:56,598
Range correction: 95,455!

17
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:59,267
- Range: 95,455!
- Yes, sir!

18
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:01,603
Breach secured!

19
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:02,854
Stand clear!

20
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:04,606
Ready! Fire!

21
00:04:20,456 --> 00:04:23,249
Defective shell.
We'll examine it. Come on.

22
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:28,505
Come on.

23
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,637
- We'd better check the fuse.
- Yes, check the fuse.

24
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,722
Yes, sir. The fuse.

25
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:13,758
Look out! Come on! Run!

26
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:30,483
- What's that?
- An air raid!

27
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:33,319
- They're after Big Bertha!
- Right! To the antiaircraft gun!

28
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:35,071
- To the gun!
- Quick!

29
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:03,266
Hey! Have you gone crazy?

30
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,351
Come down out of there!

31
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,905
Get up there, will you!

32
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:19,407
What do you think you're doing?
Have you gone crazy?

33
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,534
- Sorry, sir -
- Sir! Report from Captain Snout!

34
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:23,661
The enemy have broken through!
Every man to the front!

35
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:26,539
Muster the gun crew, quick!
You, report to Sergeant Bloom.

36
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:28,124
- Come on!
- Yes, sir!

37
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:30,752
Get your hand grenades there, soldiers.

38
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:32,545
Come on there.
Get your hand grenades.

39
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,048
Hey, soldier! Where's your hand grenade?
Hey, come here!

40
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:37,050
- Where's your hand grenade?
- Haven't got any, sir.

41
00:06:37,134 --> 00:06:39,052
Give him a hand grenade.
Go on.

42
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:45,683
Keep moving. Come along.
Move forward.

43
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:47,769
Hurry it up.
Come along. Hurry up.

44
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,271
Pardon me, sir, but to work this -
How do you -

45
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:52,357
Pull the pin, count 10 and throw it.

46
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:06,871
Let 'em have it!

47
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:19,801
Hey, come on!

48
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:29,852
Hey, this is no time to scratch.

49
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:36,567
Here, pull yourself together.

50
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:38,152
Take this.

51
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:40,488
Forward!

52
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,950
Hey, you men! Fall in here!

53
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:46,577
Hey, you, come on!
Hurry it up there!

54
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,917
Order! Arms!

55
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,963
Prepare to attack!

56
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:58,506
Forward!

57
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:13,396
Captain!

58
00:08:22,573 --> 00:08:24,073
<i>Capitán!</i>

59
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,342
There you are.

60
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:52,685
Oh, excuse me!

61
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,688
The enemy!
Come on, fellas! Let's get him!

62
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:05,114
Good afternoon, sir. May I come in?

63
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:07,283
- Who is it?
- Friend.

64
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:09,035
Come in.

65
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:12,872
- Sir.
- What division?

66
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:14,374
21 st Artillery, sir.

67
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,376
Take this. Hold 'em off.
And keep firing.

68
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,461
- I'll be back in a moment.
- Yes, sir.

69
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:38,147
Help! Comrade, help!

70
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:46,239
- What is it?
- I'm exhausted.

71
00:09:46,323 --> 00:09:48,366
Quick! Help me to my plane!

72
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,451
Yes, sir.

73
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:53,121
- Thank you, my lad.
- Steady.

74
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:55,456
I'll see you get
the Tomainian Cross for this.

75
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,376
That's all right, sir.
I'm only too willing to oblige.

76
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,803
Oh, you saved my life.

77
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:10,972
- Thank you.
- I'll strap you in.

78
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,224
I'm weak.
I can't make it alone.

79
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:15,268
- You'll have to stay with me.
- All right, sir.

80
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:17,645
- Can you fly a plane?
- I can try.

81
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,443
Quick! Lift my hand to the stick.
I haven't the strength.

82
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:26,612
- Take charge of that gun, Sergeant!
- Yes, sir!

83
00:10:26,697 --> 00:10:30,241
The enemy! They're coming!
Quick! Lift my hand to the throttle!

84
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:33,369
We'll fool 'em!

85
00:10:54,808 --> 00:10:56,809
- Here. Hold on to these dispatches.
- Yes, sir.

86
00:10:56,894 --> 00:11:00,521
If we can deliver them to General Schmelloffel,
Tomainia may yet win the day!

87
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,651
- I think I'm going to faint.
- Oh, don't say that.

88
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:07,778
I'm sorry, old man.

89
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:09,655
- Huh?
- I'm sorry.

90
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,741
Oh, wait - Please! Hey!

91
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:13,659
Hey, mister!

92
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:17,371
- Hey!
- Where am I?

93
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:19,665
- Don't you know me?
- Oh, yes. Of course.

94
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,334
- Of course.
- Yes.

95
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:23,503
Yes, I - I feel better now.

96
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:26,047
- Ah.
- The blood's returning to my head.

97
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:27,924
What's below?

98
00:11:28,008 --> 00:11:30,009
- Looks like the sun.
- The sun?

99
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:32,803
- Seems to be shining upwards.
- Strange.

100
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:35,515
- How's the gas?
- Terrible. It kept me awake all night.

101
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:37,683
No, no, no!
The gasoline in the tank!

102
00:11:37,768 --> 00:11:39,852
Oh. Almost empty.

103
00:11:39,937 --> 00:11:42,855
We must be nearly there.
What time is it?

104
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,315
Time?

105
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,735
About, approximately, one minute to 12:00.

106
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,450
Strange.

107
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:57,370
Look at that.

108
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,626
Seem to be defying
the laws of gravity.

109
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:10,216
Water!

110
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,717
- Huh?
- Quick! I'm going to faint!

111
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:14,095
Uh, wait a while. Wait a wh -

112
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:17,265
You'll get - We'll get into trouble
if you faint any more now.

113
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:18,849
- Ohh. Ohh.
- Now be careful.

114
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:20,226
- Here now. Just hold it.
- Quick.

115
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,396
Hold it. Hold it. I think I can - We'll just see -

116
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,856
Faint. Water.

117
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:30,444
- What on -
- Oh, water.

118
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,905
- Here, take it!
- Oh! Quick!

119
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,074
There's something wrong.

120
00:12:35,158 --> 00:12:36,951
Oh, I can't reach it.

121
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:39,662
Oh, water! Faint!

122
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:41,747
Ah! Oh, it's all gone!

123
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:43,541
What's the matter?

124
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,793
- This belt is too tight.
- Well, loosen it.

125
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:47,295
I'm trying to.

126
00:12:49,006 --> 00:12:50,923
We're upside down.

127
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:52,925
- I know it.
- Give me that stick!

128
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,260
Impossible.

129
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:56,220
Oh. There it goes.

130
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,014
We're out of gas.

131
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:01,100
Well, I suppose this is the end.

132
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:03,019
- Cigarette?
- Not now.

133
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,104
Then I shan't need this anymore.

134
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:06,772
What month is it?

135
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:08,190
April.

136
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:10,526
Spring in Tomainia.

137
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:14,113
Hilda will be in the garden now
tending the daffodils.

138
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:16,782
How she loves daffodils.

139
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:19,994
She would never cut them
for fear of hurting them.

140
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,706
It was like taking a life
to cut a daffodil.

141
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,751
Sweet, gentle Hilda.

142
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:34,508
A beautiful soul.

143
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:36,677
And she loved animals.

144
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:38,888
And little children too.

145
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:46,437
We've landed! Dispatches!

146
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:48,481
Comrade, where are you?

147
00:13:48,565 --> 00:13:49,899
Comrade!

148
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:57,948
Comrade, the dispatches!
Tell me, where are they?

149
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:03,245
- Are you hurt?
- Quick! Take me to General Schmelloffel!

150
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,622
- What's that?
- Hurry, man!

151
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:07,583
If I don't deliver these dispatches at once,
we're defeated!

152
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:09,085
- Well, the war's over.
- What?

153
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:10,961
- We lost.
- Lost?

154
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:07,476
<i>Hynkel Party Takes Power!</i>

155
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:10,479
<i>Meanwhile, the Jewish soldier,
ex-barber, veteran of the World War...</i>

156
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:13,899
<i>suffered a loss of memory and remained an inmate
of the soldier's hospital for many years.</i>

157
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:16,777
<i>He was ignorant of the profound change
that had come over Tomainia.</i>

158
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:19,530
<i>Hynkel the dictator ruled the nation
with an iron fist.</i>

159
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,199
<i>Under the new emblem of the Double Cross
liberty was banished...</i>

160
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:23,743
<i>free speech was suppressed...</i>

161
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:25,953
<i>and only the voice of Hynkel was heard.</i>

162
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,501
<i>...und ze sauerkraut!</i>

163
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:50,519
Baloney.

164
00:15:50,604 --> 00:15:53,606
Baloney -

165
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,208
<i>Adenoid Hynkel has just said...</i>

166
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:15,294
<i>yesterday Tomainia was down,
but today she has risen.</i>

167
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:34,814
<i>Democratzy shtunk!</i>

168
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:36,607
<i>Democracy is fragrant.</i>

169
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:38,609
<i>Liberty shtunk!</i>

170
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:40,486
<i>Liberty is odious.</i>

<i>Free sprechen shtunk!</i>

172
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:45,491
<i>Freedom of speech is objectionable.</i>

173
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,996
<i>Tomainia has the greatest army in the world.</i>

174
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,000
<i>The greatest navy in the world.</i>

175
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,757
<i>But to remain great we must sacrifice.</i>

176
00:17:05,136 --> 00:17:07,054
<i>We must tighten our belts.</i>

177
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:08,430
Hail Hynkel!

178
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:21,610
Ah, Herring.
Poopschen Herring.

<i>The Phooey now speaks to

<i>His Excellency

<i>shared by his two loyal comrades.</i>

00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,741
<i>His Excellency

<i>Und now...</i>

<i>Und mine straff mit Russia...</i>

00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,958
Tomainia!

216
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,588
<i>In conclusion, the Phooey remarks...</i>

217
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:31,675
<i>that for the rest of the world
he has nothing but peace in his heart.</i>

218
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:04,166
<i>We now pause for station identification.</i>

219
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,168
<i>This is the Peri-mutuel Network...</i>

220
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:08,670
<i>bringing you direct from Tomainia

<i>to the sons and daughters
of the Double Cross.</i>

222
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:14,676
<i>The English Interpreter is Heinrich Schtick,
Adenoid Hynkel's personal translator...</i>

223
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:17,179

from a prepared manuscript.</i>

224
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:19,181
<i>Stand by for further commentary.</i>

225
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:21,058
<i>Go ahead, Tomainia.</i>

226
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:23,811
<i>His Excellency is about to descend the stairs.</i>

227
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:32,736
Ach! Ohh! Your Excellency!

228
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:34,947
Are you hurt?

229
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:37,616
<i>Straff! Straff da fluten flavin

<i>Da fluten da banana!</i>

<i>Da banana!</i>

00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:47,960
<i>- Da banana!
- Da bitte booben!</i>

233
00:21:50,296 --> 00:21:52,297
<i>- Banana!
- Banana!</i>

234
00:21:52,382 --> 00:21:55,884
<i>Dein big booben!
Cheesen crackers!</i>

235
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:57,386
<i>Banana.</i>

236
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:05,853
Inside, da booben.

237
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:08,438
You ride in the other car.

238
00:22:12,902 --> 00:22:14,570
Thank you, children.

239
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:18,407
<i>His Excellency seems well pleased...</i>

240
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:22,995
<i>as he's greeted by a committee
of Tomainian children and their mothers.</i>

241
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,290
<i>Now he pauses
before a woman with a child.</i>

242
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:30,502
Camera.

243
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:32,504
<i>Even the baby is thrilled...</i>

244
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:35,215
<i>and seems all smiles
at His Excellency's attention.</i>

245
00:22:57,822 --> 00:22:59,865
Hail Hynkel!

246
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:02,284
<i>His Excellency leaves
the scene of his triumph...</i>

247
00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:05,287
<i>and will return to the palace along
Hynkelstrasse, the avenue of culture...</i>

248
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:07,623
<i>where he will pass Tomainia's
modern masterpieces...</i>

249
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:10,209
The Venus of Today
and The Thinker of Tomorrow.

250
00:23:19,177 --> 00:23:20,552
- How was it?
- The speech?

251
00:23:20,637 --> 00:23:22,804
- Yes.
- Oh, very good.

252
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:26,141
Thought your reference to the Jews
might have been a little more violent.

253
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:28,977
- What?
- You've got to rouse the people's anger.

254
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:33,565
At this time, violence against the Jews
might take the public's mind off its stomach.

255
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,567
Hmm. Perhaps you're right.

256
00:23:35,652 --> 00:23:38,237
Things have been quiet
in the ghetto lately.

257
00:24:02,011 --> 00:24:03,929
Good morning, Mr. Jaeckel.

258
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:05,681
What's good about it?

259
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:07,766
Well, conditions could be worse.

260
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,270
If you think they could be worse,
you have a great imagination.

261
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:13,563
Aha. You heard Hynkel's speech.

262
00:24:13,648 --> 00:24:16,900
I heard nothing.
I've got my own troubles.

263
00:24:16,985 --> 00:24:19,903
Well, you're better off
than a lot of other people.

264
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:23,282
- What have you heard from the barber?
- Still in the hospital.

265
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:26,034
Aye. Ever since the war
he's been there.

266
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,369
Yep.

267
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:30,080
Why don't you try and rent
his barbershop for him?

268
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:32,124
He won't let me.

269
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,960
Every few weeks
he writes to say he's coming back.

270
00:24:35,044 --> 00:24:38,130
It seems a pity it should be idle
all these years.

271
00:24:38,214 --> 00:24:40,132
Well, why worry?

272
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:43,302
With the taxes the government
will soon take it away from him.

273
00:24:43,386 --> 00:24:45,095
Aye, perhaps you're right.

274
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,306
It isn't such a good morning after all.

275
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,391
Now you said it.

276
00:24:50,393 --> 00:24:53,145
- Hannah.
- Yes, Mr. Jaeckel?

277
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:56,148
On the mantelpiece
you'll find my tobacco pouch.

278
00:24:56,232 --> 00:24:58,525
- Will you get it?
- All right, Mr. Jaeckel.

279
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:01,653
Yeah, seems everyone
is full of troubles.

280
00:25:01,738 --> 00:25:03,488
Ah, everyone.

281
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:05,490
Look at Hannah, poor girl.

282
00:25:05,575 --> 00:25:07,993
A hard worker.
Can't get a job.

283
00:25:08,077 --> 00:25:11,538
Father was killed in the war.
Mother died last year.

284
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:15,167
Can't earn enough to pay the rent
for her room. What can I do?

285
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:17,252
I can't throw her out.

286
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:28,221
- You'll need some more tobacco.
- Where are you going?

287
00:25:28,306 --> 00:25:30,057
I'm delivering Mrs. Shoemaker's laundry.

288
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:32,476
Oh, you'd better take the key.

289
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,895
Mrs. Jaeckel and myself
are going out.

290
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,897
I'm locking up all the doors...

291
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:39,983
in case the storm troopers will start
their monkey business again.

292
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:54,122
# The Aryan #

293
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:57,626
<i># The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #</i>

294
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,962
# As we go marching by ##

295
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:03,965
Look, fellas! Tomatoes!

296
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,550
And potatoes!

297
00:26:08,054 --> 00:26:10,138
I think I'll take a box home.

298
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:13,475
Mister, please, please.

299
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,727
Hey, fellas, the truck!

300
00:26:15,812 --> 00:26:18,313
Hold it there, will ya!

301
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:21,817
You have no right to do this.

302
00:26:21,901 --> 00:26:24,820
That's all right.
Just charge it to my account.

303
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:29,282
Nice, ripe tomatoes, boys!

304
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:33,745
Why don't some of you do something?
I wish I was a man. I'd show ya.

305
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,081
Now what would you do,
my pretty maid?

306
00:26:36,165 --> 00:26:39,835
Ah, you're very brave all together, but not
one of ya got guts to stand up alone and fight.

307
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,337
- Aw, shut up!
- Is that why you got a truck?

308
00:26:42,422 --> 00:26:45,340
- To run away in case somebody hits you back?
- Shut up, or we'll take you down.

309
00:26:45,425 --> 00:26:48,343
All right, come on and take me.
You'll get a lot of medals for it.

310
00:26:48,428 --> 00:26:51,263
That's all you can do is to pick on women
and rob defenseless people.

311
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:54,766
Aw, don't rob the poor girl, boys.
Give her back her tomatoes.

312
00:26:54,851 --> 00:26:56,351
Here!

313
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,809
Oh, I'll have to do it all over again.

314
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:41,605
Pigs.

315
00:27:45,234 --> 00:27:47,903
<i>- Send in patient 33.
- Yes, sir.</i>

316
00:27:47,987 --> 00:27:49,571
Here's an interesting case.

317
00:27:49,655 --> 00:27:51,740
Amnesia. Jewish soldier.

318
00:27:51,824 --> 00:27:55,160
Been here since the war.
Has an idea he's been here only a few weeks.

319
00:27:55,244 --> 00:27:57,454
Has he any idea
what's happened in the meantime?

320
00:27:57,538 --> 00:27:58,955
Not the least.

321
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,752
His one interest seems to be in his barbershop,
which he believes he left only a few weeks ago.

322
00:28:03,836 --> 00:28:06,254
Poor devil. He'll have
many surprises waiting for him.

323
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,590
I'm afraid so.

324
00:28:08,674 --> 00:28:10,675
<i>- Yes?
- Number 33 is gone.</i>

325
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,677
Gone?
But he was to be examined.

326
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:15,680
<i>- I know, sir, but he disappeared.
- Disappeared?</i>

327
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:19,017
Well, let him go.
It isn't a serious case.

328
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:21,603
Besides, there's little more
we can do for him.

329
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:48,189
Hey, go on.
Beat it up there.

330
00:29:48,274 --> 00:29:50,609
Come on! Get outta -
You! Go on!

331
00:30:15,468 --> 00:30:17,802
What do you think you're doing?

332
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:20,639
- I really don't know.
- Well, you leave that alone.

333
00:30:21,891 --> 00:30:24,100
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not silly!

334
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:25,602
I appreciate that.

335
00:30:25,686 --> 00:30:28,063
When you talk to me,
hail Hynkel and salute.

336
00:30:28,147 --> 00:30:29,648
Who are you anyway?

337
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:33,568
I'll show you who I am.

338
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:35,320
Come down to headquarters.

339
00:30:35,404 --> 00:30:38,323
- Say, that's my shop!
- I don't care if it is or not.

340
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:41,159
- You leave me alone!
- Oh! Gonna put up a fight, are ya?

341
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:44,329
Come on down, pal.
I'll show you.

342
00:30:44,413 --> 00:30:46,831
Now let me tell you something -

343
00:30:50,002 --> 00:30:53,088
Are you a policeman?
Arrest that man for assault.

344
00:30:53,172 --> 00:30:55,090
- Come here, you!
- Leave me alone!

345
00:30:55,174 --> 00:30:57,717
Attacking a storm trooper, huh?

346
00:30:57,802 --> 00:30:59,469
- Take him down!
- You'll hear from my lawyer!

347
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:02,180
- Come on, you little -
- Why, you -

348
00:31:02,264 --> 00:31:05,308
Turn him around!

349
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:07,686
He bit my finger!

350
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:43,179
<i>Pardon.</i>

351
00:31:59,113 --> 00:32:01,614
Oh, I'm sorry, mister.
I didn't mean to hit you.

352
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:03,658
You were wonderful.
I enjoyed that.

353
00:32:03,743 --> 00:32:06,578
- But don't stand there. You'd better beat it.
- No, I'll call a policeman.

354
00:32:06,662 --> 00:32:08,288
- No, no, don't do that.
- Why not?

355
00:32:08,372 --> 00:32:10,081
You crazy?

356
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,083
- Look out. There's more coming.
- More what?

357
00:32:12,168 --> 00:32:13,877
Wait a minute!

358
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:21,509
Come in here!

359
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:26,931
What's wrong with you?
There's no use being foolhardy.

360
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:28,683
- Who?
- Shh!

361
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:34,397
Stop the car!

362
00:32:36,066 --> 00:32:38,943
Hello! What's this?
Who hit you?

363
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:43,198
- I don't know. I think there were a gang of 'em.
- Here, you'd better go along, get fixed up.

364
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:44,908
We'll investigate later.

365
00:32:44,992 --> 00:32:47,243
- What time is it?
- Come on. Get in.

366
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:57,295
I don't see what is -

367
00:33:07,473 --> 00:33:09,641
It's all right now.
They've gone.

368
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:11,309
Thanks, mister.

369
00:33:11,393 --> 00:33:13,520
That did me a lot of good.

370
00:33:16,148 --> 00:33:18,983
You sure got nerve,
the way you fought back.

371
00:33:19,068 --> 00:33:21,778
That's what we should all do -
fight back.

372
00:33:21,862 --> 00:33:25,281
We can't fight alone,
but we can lick 'em together.

373
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:28,993
We didn't do so bad, did we?

374
00:33:29,078 --> 00:33:30,787
So long.

375
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:49,597
Oh, excuse me.

376
00:33:49,682 --> 00:33:52,684
You're the barber,
the one that was in the hospital.

377
00:33:52,768 --> 00:33:56,980
Mr. Jaeckel's often talked about you.
We didn't think you were ever coming back.

378
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:01,359
But the storm troopers,
they'll be looking for ya.

379
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:02,694
Storm troopers?

380
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:05,989
You'd better hide.
Wait. I'll get the key to the cellar.

381
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:16,291
- Is this the man?
- That's him.

382
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:18,543
Hail Hynkel.

383
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:19,794
Who's he?

384
00:34:20,462 --> 00:34:23,548
Don't fool with me.
I said, hail Hynkel!

385
00:34:23,632 --> 00:34:25,800
- All right.
- Put out your hands.

386
00:34:25,885 --> 00:34:29,137
Just a moment. We won't put 'em on here.
Bring him outside.

387
00:34:29,221 --> 00:34:31,639
Yes. Come on, you.
Come on!

388
00:34:33,225 --> 00:34:36,227
Before we take you down
you'll finish this. Here.

389
00:34:37,938 --> 00:34:39,314
Go on. Paint that.

390
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,649
Why, you -

391
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:55,246
That's him!

392
00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:20,563
Wait a minute, boys! Wait a minute!

393
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:23,107
I've got an idea.
A bright idea.

394
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:25,526
Sure! That's it!

395
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,789
- And... give it the works!
- Heave ho!

396
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,292
Wait a minute! Commander Schultz!

397
00:35:42,044 --> 00:35:43,419
Attention!

398
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:49,050
First in command.

399
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:52,387
- Yes, sir.
- What the -

400
00:35:52,471 --> 00:35:54,389
Second in command.

401
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,475
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, never mind.

402
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,810
- You!
- Yes, sir.

403
00:35:58,894 --> 00:36:01,437
What the devil goes on here? And who
told you to hang people from lampposts?

404
00:36:01,522 --> 00:36:04,148
- No one, sir.
- My orders were to keep these streets tidy.

405
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:06,693
- What was the trouble?
- A Jew was attacking storm troopers, sir.

406
00:36:06,777 --> 00:36:08,820
- Where is he?
- There.

407
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:10,571
Break ranks.

408
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:15,952
Oh, so there you are.
Stand him up.

409
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,287
Get up.

410
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:25,044
You!

411
00:36:26,046 --> 00:36:28,172
Don't you remember me?

412
00:36:28,257 --> 00:36:30,174
The war.
You saved my life.

413
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:32,552
- Me?
- Strange.

414
00:36:32,636 --> 00:36:35,179
And I always thought of you as an Aryan.

415
00:36:35,264 --> 00:36:37,223
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Well, don't you remember?

416
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:40,268
The enemy tried to capture us,
but we got away in my plane.

417
00:36:40,352 --> 00:36:41,769
Plane?

418
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:44,439
And then we crashed.

419
00:36:44,523 --> 00:36:46,190
Cra -

420
00:36:48,777 --> 00:36:50,778
Oh, yes.

421
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:52,530
Now I remember.

422
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:56,659
- Well, how are you?
- What has my friend done?

423
00:36:56,744 --> 00:36:59,162
Our men were painting his windows,
Commander, and he resisted.

424
00:36:59,246 --> 00:37:01,247
Any brave man would resist.

425
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:04,250
- I'm sorry this occurred.
- Oh. No harm.

426
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:07,420
I'm sure that in the future
you will not be molested again.

427
00:37:07,504 --> 00:37:10,965
However, if you or your friends are ever
in any trouble, I hope you'll let me know.

428
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:15,178
Who did that?

429
00:37:15,262 --> 00:37:18,306
Oh. One of my friends.

430
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:21,768
Oh. Of course.

431
00:37:27,983 --> 00:37:30,902
<i>Hynkel's palace was
the center of a gigantic enterprise...</i>

432
00:37:30,986 --> 00:37:33,905
<i>an enterprise that would build
the world's greatest war machine.</i>

433
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:36,908
<i>Behind this undertaking was
the dynamic energy of Adenoid Hynkel...</i>

434
00:37:36,992 --> 00:37:38,910
<i>whose amazing genius
ran the entire nation...</i>

435
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:42,997
<i>whose ceaseless activity kept him
busily occupied every moment of the day.</i>

436
00:37:47,252 --> 00:37:48,753
Hup!

437
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:12,318
<i>Marshal Herring is waiting,
Your Excellency.</i>

438
00:38:12,402 --> 00:38:13,694
Enough.

439
00:38:15,823 --> 00:38:17,073
Hail Hynkel.

440
00:38:17,157 --> 00:38:19,742
Your Excellency,
I believe we've got something now.

441
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:23,121
A bulletproof uniform.
Material as light as silk.

442
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:26,165
- Where is it?
- I've arranged for a demonstration in the anteroom.

443
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,251
It will only take two minutes.

444
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:30,920
I can spare one.

445
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:37,802
- Professor Herr Kibitzen!
- Hail Hynkel!

446
00:38:37,886 --> 00:38:40,429
Your Excellency,
actions speak louder than words.

447
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:43,933
- A bulletproof uniform!
- And 100% perfect!

448
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:47,019
Shoot.

449
00:38:52,568 --> 00:38:54,152
Far from perfect.

450
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:33,900
Zevell!

451
00:39:36,862 --> 00:39:39,280
- My secretary. Where is she?
- In the outer office, Your Excellency.

452
00:39:39,364 --> 00:39:40,698
- Call her.
- Yes, sir.

453
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,292
Hail Hynkel.

454
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:54,629
Take a letter.

455
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:10,686
No! No, no!

456
00:40:20,155 --> 00:40:21,822
<i>- Hello?
- This is Field Marshal Herring.</i>

457
00:40:21,907 --> 00:40:24,408
<i>I'm in the Tower Room.
We've got something marvelous.</i>

458
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:26,494
All right. I shall be up.

459
00:40:42,594 --> 00:40:44,262
- What is it?
- A parachute.

460
00:40:44,346 --> 00:40:47,932
The most compact in the world.
Worn like an ordinary hat.

461
00:40:50,102 --> 00:40:52,103
It will open in 25 feet.

462
00:40:52,187 --> 00:40:54,188
Demonstrate, Professor.

463
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,447
Hail Hynkel!

464
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:17,461
Herring, why do you
waste my time like this?

465
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,683
Send Garbitsch here.

466
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:43,487
<i>Herr Garbitsch is waiting, Your Excellency.</i>

467
00:41:43,572 --> 00:41:45,239
Enough.

468
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:50,453
Hail Hynkel.

469
00:41:50,537 --> 00:41:52,538
Garbitsch, what's the meaning of this,
these appropriations?

470
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:56,167
25 million for prison camps when we need
every penny for the manufacturing of munitions.

471
00:41:56,251 --> 00:41:58,669
- We've had to make a few arrests.
- A few? How many?

472
00:41:58,754 --> 00:42:00,421
Nothing astronomical.
Five or ten thousand.

473
00:42:00,505 --> 00:42:02,006
- Oh.
- A day.

474
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,175
- A day?
- Just a few dissenters, that's all.

475
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:07,386
- What do they dissent about?
- The working hours. The cut in wages.

476
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:11,098
Chiefly, the synthetic food -
the quality of the sawdust in the bread.

477
00:42:11,183 --> 00:42:14,935
What more do they want? It's from
the finest lumber our mills can supply.

478
00:42:17,397 --> 00:42:20,024
Nevertheless,
the condition is getting dangerous.

479
00:42:20,108 --> 00:42:22,026
The people are overworked.
They need diversion.

480
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,361
The people? Bah!

481
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:26,655
We might go a little further with the Jews.
Burn down some of their houses.

482
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,533
Spectacular assault on the ghetto now
might prove diverting.

483
00:42:29,618 --> 00:42:32,703
We must do something more dramatic.
Now is the time to invade Osterlich.

484
00:42:32,788 --> 00:42:35,206
- How soon can we be ready?
- According to Herring, three months.

485
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,751
I can't wait that long. Besides, Napaloni's army
might invade Osterlich before me.

486
00:42:38,835 --> 00:42:40,211
We must strike now.

487
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:42,338
In that case,
we should require foreign capital.

488
00:42:42,422 --> 00:42:45,216
- Borrow it. Borrow it.
- The bankers have all refused.

489
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,177
But wait. There's one man
who might make us a loan - Epstein.

490
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:50,513
Epstein?
He's a Jew, isn't he?

491
00:42:50,597 --> 00:42:52,390
Yes.

492
00:42:52,474 --> 00:42:55,976
Well, let's be big about it.
We'll borrow the money from Epstein.

493
00:42:57,145 --> 00:43:00,564
It might be difficult
in view of our policy towards his people.

494
00:43:00,649 --> 00:43:02,983
Very well then.
We'll change our policy towards his people.

495
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:06,737
Tell Commander Schultz that in future
all persecution of the Jews must cease...

496
00:43:06,822 --> 00:43:10,199
at least until
we've negotiated this loan.

497
00:43:16,415 --> 00:43:17,998
I don't understand it.

498
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:20,459
The whole ghetto is so quiet now.

499
00:43:20,544 --> 00:43:23,587
You can't imagine what was going on
while you were away.

500
00:43:23,672 --> 00:43:26,257
Oh, this Hynkel business.

501
00:43:26,341 --> 00:43:30,177
You weren't here.
You were in the hospital, unconscious.

502
00:43:30,262 --> 00:43:33,389
Believe me, you don't appreciate
what a good time you were having.

503
00:43:35,183 --> 00:43:38,269
Well, if things get worse
we can go to Osterlich.

504
00:43:38,353 --> 00:43:40,354
That's still a free country.

505
00:43:40,439 --> 00:43:43,274
Sooner or later we'll have to go.

506
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:45,276
- Excuse me.
- Anyway...

507
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,486
it's nice to see you back.

508
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:49,488
It's like the old days again, eh?

509
00:43:49,573 --> 00:43:52,116
- Yes.
- How's business?

510
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,160
Very slow. Very slow.

511
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,789
Trouble is, the men
are all in concentration camps.

512
00:43:58,874 --> 00:44:01,625
You should go in
for fixing up the women.

513
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,711
Nice money
in the beauty parlor business.

514
00:44:03,795 --> 00:44:06,714
You know anything about it?

515
00:44:09,718 --> 00:44:11,469
Me? No.

516
00:44:11,553 --> 00:44:13,512
Well, you can learn.

517
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:15,097
You can practice on Hannah.

518
00:44:15,182 --> 00:44:16,849
Yes!

519
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:19,852
Of course.
Hannah, get up in that chair.

520
00:44:19,936 --> 00:44:21,854
We are going to make you
look beautiful.

521
00:44:21,938 --> 00:44:23,606
Beautiful? What for?

522
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:26,233
He's going to practice on you
for a beauty parlor.

523
00:44:28,987 --> 00:44:31,405
You're not gonna put mud
on my face, are you?

524
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:33,824
Ah, we are going to take some off.

525
00:44:35,744 --> 00:44:37,453
Make me look beautiful?

526
00:44:37,537 --> 00:44:40,164
Sure. We can't make you
look any worse.

527
00:44:42,584 --> 00:44:45,836
- Hannah!
- Oh, there's Mrs. Shoemaker for the laundry.

528
00:44:45,921 --> 00:44:47,963
That's all right.
I'll give it to her.

529
00:44:48,048 --> 00:44:50,799
- You sit here and enjoy yourself.
- What?

530
00:44:50,884 --> 00:44:54,553
I know.
I've seen you making eyes.

531
00:44:56,556 --> 00:44:59,934
Don't pay any attention to Mr. Jaeckel.

532
00:45:02,604 --> 00:45:05,189
I like your shop since we fixed it up.

533
00:45:06,441 --> 00:45:08,526
I wish I had a business like this.

534
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,986
There's no future in housework.

535
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:13,989
Maybe if I save my money
I can have a barbershop someday.

536
00:45:14,074 --> 00:45:16,367
But I can never save.

537
00:45:16,451 --> 00:45:19,745
Money slips through my fingers
like that.

538
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:23,040
Trouble is, I've always lived up
to every penny I've earned.

539
00:45:23,124 --> 00:45:26,794
Why shouldn't I? You're here today
and gone tomorrow. And then where are you?

540
00:45:28,547 --> 00:45:30,673
- Do you believe in God?
- Well -

541
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:34,593
I do. But if there wasn't one,
would you live any different?

542
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:38,847
I wouldn't. Life could be wonderful
if people'd leave you alone.

543
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:41,892
Things are looking brighter now.

544
00:45:41,977 --> 00:45:45,646
Maybe you're the reason,
saving Commander Schultz's life.

545
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:49,858
Funny how they've left us alone lately.
Seems too good to be true.

546
00:45:56,825 --> 00:45:58,742
Do you ever daydream?

547
00:45:58,827 --> 00:46:00,160
I do.

548
00:46:01,162 --> 00:46:04,999
That's the only time I'm really happy -
dreaming.

549
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,584
Back.

550
00:46:08,878 --> 00:46:12,923
Sometimes I get so carried away I don't know
what I'm doing. Aren't you like that?

551
00:46:14,968 --> 00:46:17,094
- Do you know we're very much alike?
- Are we?

552
00:46:17,178 --> 00:46:18,762
Yeah.
We're both absentminded.

553
00:46:18,847 --> 00:46:20,472
- You think so?
- Yes.

554
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:26,854
I like absentminded people.

555
00:46:31,693 --> 00:46:33,944
Do you know the story about the man
that put his watch in boiling water...

556
00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:35,446
and held the egg in his hand?

557
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,281
No!

558
00:46:37,365 --> 00:46:39,825
Very good.

559
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:45,664
They say all great men
are absentminded.

560
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:48,584
It's a sign they're smart.

561
00:46:48,668 --> 00:46:50,669
My folks didn't think so.

562
00:46:53,673 --> 00:46:56,300
Of course there's an excuse for you.
You were injured in the war.

563
00:46:56,384 --> 00:46:59,053
I was born that way.

564
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,937
Wonder why women
never grow whiskers.

565
00:47:09,022 --> 00:47:10,814
Hmm? What?

566
00:47:10,899 --> 00:47:12,399
I s -

567
00:47:15,403 --> 00:47:17,404
What -

568
00:47:18,615 --> 00:47:21,283
- Oh, my!
- Isn't that foolish of me!

569
00:47:21,368 --> 00:47:24,036
I could kick myself in the shins, I could.

570
00:47:25,246 --> 00:47:27,414
I'll give you a shampoo.

571
00:47:27,499 --> 00:47:28,999
That's good.

572
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,423
Voilà.

573
00:47:40,595 --> 00:47:42,262
Gee.

574
00:47:43,306 --> 00:47:45,099
Ain't I cute!

575
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,103
How'd you do it?

576
00:47:51,064 --> 00:47:53,691
You should try it on yourself.

577
00:47:53,775 --> 00:47:56,276
If you were fixed up,
you'd look handsome.

578
00:47:56,361 --> 00:47:58,237
- Yes?
- Yes!

579
00:48:00,281 --> 00:48:01,532
No.

580
00:48:01,616 --> 00:48:04,326
Four pecks a pound! New potatoes!

581
00:48:04,411 --> 00:48:07,621
There's the potato man.
I have to go.

582
00:48:11,376 --> 00:48:13,460
Potatoes!

583
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:15,212
One, please!

584
00:48:21,386 --> 00:48:24,513
Take it easy there.

585
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:27,808
Well, did you hurt yourself?

586
00:48:33,314 --> 00:48:35,566
- Careful next time.
- Here's another one.

587
00:48:39,487 --> 00:48:41,363
How do you do?

588
00:48:49,247 --> 00:48:52,916
Something's happened. I know it.
The storm troopers, they helped me up.

589
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,378
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if they stopped hating us...

590
00:48:56,463 --> 00:49:00,090
if they'd leave us alone and let us
go about our business like we used to.

591
00:49:00,175 --> 00:49:03,677
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we didn't
have to leave and go to another country?

592
00:49:03,762 --> 00:49:08,807
I don't want to go away. With all the hardship
and the persecution, I love it here.

593
00:49:08,892 --> 00:49:11,477
Perhaps we don't have to go.

594
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:15,397
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if they'd let us live and be happy again?

595
00:49:52,477 --> 00:49:54,394
Period.

596
00:49:59,234 --> 00:50:00,734
<i>Danke schoen.</i>

597
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:26,552
Nothing works! Not a decent pen!
Not even a sharp pencil!

598
00:50:26,636 --> 00:50:30,138
I'm surrounded by nothing but incompetent,
stupid, sterile stenographers!

599
00:50:30,223 --> 00:50:32,724
- I'll get you a pen.
- Don't bother.

600
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:34,726
I won't send it.

601
00:50:34,811 --> 00:50:36,812
Get out! Get out! Get out!

602
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:46,613
We've just discovered the most wonderful,
the most marvelous poison gas!

603
00:50:48,032 --> 00:50:50,534
It will kill everybody!

604
00:50:50,618 --> 00:50:52,870
All right, later, later, later.

605
00:50:52,954 --> 00:50:54,872
<i>B-76 to see Herr Herring.</i>

606
00:50:54,956 --> 00:50:56,373
- Who's that?
- A lady.

607
00:50:56,457 --> 00:50:58,667
My secret agent.

608
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:01,211
Your secret agent.
Tell her to come here.

609
00:51:01,296 --> 00:51:02,921
Have B-76 come right in.

610
00:51:03,923 --> 00:51:05,340
Hail Hynkel.

611
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:07,843
- Oh, Garbitsch, what do you hear from Epstein?
- Most encouraging.

612
00:51:07,927 --> 00:51:12,306
Our agent reports that all the board of directors
are Aryans, so the loan is bound to go through.

613
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:14,766
- Good.
- Hail Hynkel.

614
00:51:17,478 --> 00:51:18,979
Come here.

615
00:51:21,774 --> 00:51:24,401
- Well?
- The men are planning a strike at the arms factory.

616
00:51:24,485 --> 00:51:26,820
- Who's the leader?
- There were five of them.

617
00:51:26,905 --> 00:51:30,073
- Have them shot.
- They were, Your Excellency.

618
00:51:32,827 --> 00:51:36,330
- How many do you say were going on strike?
- The whole factory - 3,000 of them.

619
00:51:36,414 --> 00:51:39,541
Have them all shot. I don't want
any of my workers dissatisfied.

620
00:51:39,626 --> 00:51:41,793
But, Your Excellency,
these men are skilled craftsmen.

621
00:51:41,878 --> 00:51:44,838
Why not let them work till
they can train others, then shoot them?

622
00:51:44,923 --> 00:51:46,590
We cannot afford to be lenient!

623
00:51:46,674 --> 00:51:49,217
The whole rhythm of production
will be affected if you shoot them now.

624
00:51:49,302 --> 00:51:52,054
"Rhythm of production. "
All right, have your rhythms.

625
00:51:52,138 --> 00:51:56,016
You may instruct your operatives to spare
the strikers and permit them to return to work...

626
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,185
but to mark them
for future reference.

627
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:00,979
That is my department.
I'll attend to that.

628
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:02,689
This way, madam.

629
00:52:07,445 --> 00:52:11,198
Strange. These strike leaders - they're
all brunettes. Not a blonde amongst them.

630
00:52:11,282 --> 00:52:13,241
Brunettes are troublemakers.
They're worse than the Jews.

631
00:52:13,326 --> 00:52:14,785
Then wipe them out.

632
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:17,162
<i>Doucement.
Not so fast.</i>

633
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:20,040
We get rid of the Jews first.
Then concentrate on the brunettes.

634
00:52:20,124 --> 00:52:23,585
We shall never have peace
until we have a pure Aryan race.

635
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:24,962
How wonderful.

636
00:52:25,046 --> 00:52:27,965
Tomainia, a nation
of blue-eyed blondes.

637
00:52:28,049 --> 00:52:30,676
Why not a blonde Europe,
a blonde Asia, a blonde America?

638
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,678
- A blonde world.
- And a brunette dictator.

639
00:52:32,762 --> 00:52:33,971
Dictator of the world.

640
00:52:34,055 --> 00:52:35,681
Why not?

641
00:52:35,765 --> 00:52:37,516
<i>Aut Caesar aut nulles.</i>

642
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,893
The world is effete, worn-out, afraid.

643
00:52:39,978 --> 00:52:42,104
No nation would dare to oppose you.

644
00:52:42,188 --> 00:52:44,648
- Dictator of the world!
- It's your destiny.

645
00:52:44,732 --> 00:52:47,818
We'll kill off the Jews,
wipe out the brunettes.

646
00:52:47,902 --> 00:52:50,988
Then will come forth our dream -
a pure Aryan race.

647
00:52:51,072 --> 00:52:54,116
- Beautiful blonde Aryans.
- They will love you. They will adore you.

648
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,452
- They will worship you as a god!
- No, no! You mustn't say it!

649
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:03,750
You make me afraid of myself.

650
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:14,261
Yes, dictator of the world.

651
00:53:14,345 --> 00:53:16,263
We'll start
with the invasion of Osterlich.

652
00:53:16,347 --> 00:53:18,265
After that we won't have to fight.
We can bluff.

653
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:20,267
Nation after nation will capitulate.

654
00:53:20,351 --> 00:53:23,186
Within two years
the world will be under your thumb!

655
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:26,565
Leave me.
I want to be alone.

<i>Aut Caesar aut nulles.</i>

658
00:54:06,147 --> 00:54:08,565

<i>This is the Happy Hour program.</i>

661

don't it?

667
00:58:16,897 --> 00:58:19,149
I wonder how long

668
00:58:19,233 --> 00:58:20,817
Don't you read the papers?

669
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:23,987
It is rumored that Hynkel is going to
give the Jewish people back their rights.

670
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:25,739
Hmm. Maybe.

671
00:58:25,823 --> 00:58:27,324
What do you want?

672
00:58:27,408 --> 00:58:31,077
Business is much better.
Nobody interferes with us anymore.

673
00:58:31,162 --> 00:58:33,371
Now don't that make you feel good?

674
00:58:33,456 --> 00:58:35,040
No, sir.

675
00:58:35,124 --> 00:58:39,586
The trouble, Mr. Jaeckel, is, you're so used
to bad times you're unhappy without them.

676
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,797
Mary? Mary!
Get my Sunday shoes.

- You'll find them on the window sill.
- All right.

678
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,845
- I can't find the shawl.
- Don't bother. I've got the shawl.

679
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:51,431
- What's going on upstairs?
- It's Hannah.

680
00:58:51,515 --> 00:58:53,767
They're dressing her up
to go out this evening.

681
00:58:53,851 --> 00:58:56,770
- Is that so?
- She's got a beau.

682
00:58:56,854 --> 00:58:58,980
- Who is it?
- The barber.

683
00:58:59,774 --> 00:59:01,941
Now turn around.

684

Oh, my dear, those hands.

685
00:59:05,696 --> 00:59:09,282
- What's the matter with them?
- Those calluses - they're so rough.

686
00:59:09,367 --> 00:59:12,160
- Maybe I'd better not go.
- Don't be foolish.

He knows you do housework.

688

Wait a minute.
I'll get a pair of mittens from Mrs. Morris.

689
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:21,044
- Mrs. Morris?
- Yes, Mrs. Jaeckel? Come in!

- See if he's ready yet.

692
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,301
All right.

693

Not yet.
He's polishing a bald man's head.

694
00:59:50,741 --> 00:59:52,325
Bad news.

695
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:54,452
The invasion of Osterlich
will have to be delayed.

696
00:59:54,537 --> 00:59:57,789
- What?
- Epstein refuses to lend us the money.

697
00:59:59,917 --> 01:00:01,876
Epstein refuses, huh?

698
01:00:06,215 --> 01:00:07,674
Send for Schultz!

699
01:00:08,759 --> 01:00:10,176
Commander Schultz.

700
01:00:10,261 --> 01:00:12,178
Epstein refuses!

701
01:00:15,266 --> 01:00:17,976
That contemptible Epstein!
What did he say?

702
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,186
He complained
of the persecution of his people...

703
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:24,190
and said under no circumstances would he
have any dealings with a medieval maniac.

704
01:00:24,275 --> 01:00:27,610
He'll deal with a medieval maniac
more than he thinks!

705
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:33,199
First I shall deal with "his people. "

706
01:00:33,284 --> 01:00:34,826
Your Excellency?

707
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:37,036
Schultz, call out the storm troopers.

708
01:00:37,121 --> 01:00:40,290
We're going to stage
a little medieval entertainment in the ghetto.

709
01:00:40,374 --> 01:00:43,376
At such a time, Your Excellency,
I think it's ill-advised.

710
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:44,711
What?

711
01:00:44,795 --> 01:00:47,297
Demonstrations of this kind
are demoralizing the whole country.

712
01:00:47,381 --> 01:00:49,048
Indeed.

713
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:53,136
And since when have you been
so concerned about the ghetto?

714
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:56,514
I speak in the interests of our party
and for the cause of humanity.

715
01:00:58,392 --> 01:00:59,684
Schultz.

716
01:00:59,768 --> 01:01:01,644
You need a vacation.

717
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,230
Fresh air.

718
01:01:06,775 --> 01:01:09,277
A little outdoor exercise.

719
01:01:10,571 --> 01:01:13,198
I shall send you
to a concentration camp.

720
01:01:14,074 --> 01:01:15,408
Guards!

721
01:01:16,202 --> 01:01:18,119
Place Commander Schultz under arrest.

722
01:01:18,204 --> 01:01:20,413
Very well,
but remember my words.

723
01:01:20,498 --> 01:01:25,335
Your cause is doomed to failure because it's built on
the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people.

724
01:01:25,419 --> 01:01:27,337
Your policy is worse than a crime.

725
01:01:27,421 --> 01:01:29,589
It's a tragic blunder.

726
01:01:29,673 --> 01:01:31,925
Traitor! Traitor!

727
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,595
You're nothing
but a double-dyed democrat!

728
01:01:58,285 --> 01:02:01,788
Schultz, why have you forsaken me?

729
01:02:14,343 --> 01:02:17,428
Excellency, here are the notes
for your speech.

730
01:02:17,513 --> 01:02:19,180
Thank you.

731
01:02:30,234 --> 01:02:32,068
I'll not need them.

732
01:02:32,152 --> 01:02:36,030
What I say tonight will not be directed
to the sons and daughters of the Double Cross...

733
01:02:36,115 --> 01:02:39,909
but to the children of Israel.

734
01:03:11,025 --> 01:03:13,776

- Good evening.

735

01:07:11,181 --> 01:07:14,100
<i># The Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan ##</i>

784
01:07:19,064 --> 01:07:21,774
Orders or no orders,
I'm gonna get that girl.

785
01:07:23,735 --> 01:07:28,823
Out.

786
01:07:28,907 --> 01:07:30,408
<i>Aww.</i>

787
01:07:41,545 --> 01:07:43,546
Extry! Paper!

788
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:46,632
- Schultz arrested! Paper!
- Did you hear that?

789
01:07:46,717 --> 01:07:48,634
- He's arrested Commander Schultz.
- What?

790
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:50,386
Commander Schultz
has been arrested!

791
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,513
- Troopers!
- Listen.

792
01:07:52,598 --> 01:07:55,850
- A Jew corrupted our commander!
- Let's kill the lot of them!

793
01:07:56,977 --> 01:07:59,228
Commander Schultz
is under arrest, accused of treason!

794
01:07:59,313 --> 01:08:03,900
And you know why. Schultz was a friend
of the ghetto, a friend of that barber!

795
01:08:03,984 --> 01:08:07,278
- Let's get the barber!
- We want the barber!

796
01:08:07,362 --> 01:08:08,905
We want the barber!

797
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:10,865
- It's the storm troopers! They're after you!
- We want the barber!

798
01:08:10,949 --> 01:08:13,117
- You better get up on the roof.
- No. I'll stay here.

799
01:08:13,201 --> 01:08:14,702
Come on! They'll kill you!

800
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:17,121
- No, I'll stay and fight!
- Don't be a fool!

801
01:08:17,205 --> 01:08:19,498
Do you want to be murdered?
Get on to the roof. Quick!

802
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:22,418
- Come on! Come on!
- Agar, get inside.

803
01:08:22,502 --> 01:08:26,005
We want the barber!
We want the barber!

804
01:08:26,089 --> 01:08:27,673
We want the barber!

805
01:08:27,758 --> 01:08:30,843
All right, here we are!
Smash in the door! Come on!

806
01:08:32,763 --> 01:08:34,096
Come on, boys!

807
01:08:34,181 --> 01:08:36,724
Come on, boys!
We'll give the barber a haircut!

808
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:44,649
- All right, where are the bombs?
- Come on. This way!

809
01:08:44,733 --> 01:08:46,359
Let 'er go!

810
01:08:48,487 --> 01:08:53,658
# Aryan, the Ary-Ary-Ary-Ary-Aryan #

811
01:09:02,834 --> 01:09:04,710
There goes the barbershop.

812
01:09:07,631 --> 01:09:09,799
Never mind. We can start again.

813
01:09:09,883 --> 01:09:13,135
We can go to Osterlich.
That's still a free country.

814
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,554
Mr. Jaeckel says it's beautiful there.

815
01:09:15,639 --> 01:09:18,724
Wonderful green fields,
and they grow apples and grapes.

816
01:09:19,518 --> 01:09:22,061
Mr. Jaeckel's brother's got a vineyard
in Osterlich.

817
01:09:22,145 --> 01:09:25,606
And when Mr. Jaeckel goes there,
he said he'd take me with him.

818
01:09:25,691 --> 01:09:27,608
Now we can all go together.

819
01:09:28,443 --> 01:09:31,404
It'll be wonderful living in the country.

820
01:09:31,488 --> 01:09:34,448
Much better than a smoky old city.

821
01:09:35,158 --> 01:09:38,577
And if we work hard and don't eat much,
we can save money.

822
01:09:39,496 --> 01:09:41,747
We can buy a chicken farm.

823
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:45,084
There's nice money
to be made in chickens.

824
01:10:07,983 --> 01:10:09,775
Look at that star.

825
01:10:11,695 --> 01:10:13,654
Isn't it beautiful?

826
01:10:17,117 --> 01:10:20,786
One thing - Hynkel with all his power
can never touch that.

827
01:10:23,457 --> 01:10:26,459
It's all right now.
The coast is clear. Listen.

828
01:10:26,543 --> 01:10:28,836
Commander Schultz escaped.
He's hiding in my cellar.

829
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:29,879
What?

830
01:10:29,963 --> 01:10:33,549
He's holding a meeting at midnight
and he wants you to be there.

831
01:10:33,633 --> 01:10:35,384
Hannah, you too come down...

832
01:10:35,469 --> 01:10:37,219
and help Mrs. Jaeckel with the supper.

833
01:10:37,304 --> 01:10:38,804
All right. I'll be down.

834
01:10:43,477 --> 01:10:45,311
I don't understand it.

835
01:10:45,395 --> 01:10:47,980
This crazy midnight supper.

836
01:10:48,065 --> 01:10:50,900
What does this Commander Schultz
want of us?

837
01:10:50,984 --> 01:10:53,069
He wants us to blow up the palace.

838
01:10:53,153 --> 01:10:54,820
What?

839
01:10:54,905 --> 01:10:58,324
We Jewish people shouldn't
get mixed up in such a business.

840
01:10:58,408 --> 01:11:02,036
I know it, but Commander Schultz is such
a good talker, he has them all hypnotized.

841
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,288
I knew he was up to some mischief.

842
01:11:04,372 --> 01:11:05,998
Sure, he is!

843
01:11:07,084 --> 01:11:08,709
I came in the kitchen this evening...

844
01:11:08,794 --> 01:11:11,504
and found him putting a coin
in one of your puddings.

845
01:11:11,588 --> 01:11:14,048
Putting a coin in one of the puddings?

846
01:11:14,132 --> 01:11:17,802
But don't worry. I've fixed everything.
Wait and see.

847
01:11:17,886 --> 01:11:22,598
Gentlemen, may I claim
your indulgence for a moment?

848
01:11:22,682 --> 01:11:27,103
We are here tonight
to rid the country of a tyrant.

849
01:11:27,938 --> 01:11:30,731
In order to carry out this plan,
one of us must die.

850
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:37,196
In ancient times,
the Aryan tribe of Langobardians...

851
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,157
made human sacrifice to the god Thor.

852
01:11:41,535 --> 01:11:44,453
At a feast by lottery
the victim was chosen.

853
01:11:44,538 --> 01:11:48,124
Tonight at this feast
one of you will be chosen.

854
01:11:52,129 --> 01:11:54,213
Each man will receive a pudding.

855
01:11:54,297 --> 01:11:56,757
Concealed in one of these is a coin.

856
01:11:56,842 --> 01:12:00,094
Whoever gets that coin must give up his life
for the liberation of his people.

857
01:12:00,178 --> 01:12:04,890
But he will join the long line
of history's noble martyrs...

858
01:12:04,975 --> 01:12:08,727
and will rid his country of a tyrant.

859
01:12:11,898 --> 01:12:12,898
Ooh!

860
01:12:19,781 --> 01:12:22,408
I know that it is the wish
of all of us...

861
01:12:22,492 --> 01:12:25,327
to be chosen this night
to die for Tomainia.

862
01:12:26,163 --> 01:12:29,081
Much as I should like
to participate in this ordeal...

863
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:30,666
I cannot.

864
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,251
Why?

865
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:38,174
Don't you understand?
He's too well-known.

866
01:12:38,258 --> 01:12:40,926
It must be done by somebody like us.

867
01:12:41,011 --> 01:12:42,761
I can't see it like that.

868
01:12:42,846 --> 01:12:46,682
Gentlemen, if this is a question of my honor,
it's very embarrassing.

869
01:12:48,351 --> 01:12:51,645
Commander Schultz,
I apologize for my friend.

870
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:55,107
And let me say on behalf
of myself and the others...

871
01:12:55,192 --> 01:12:59,028
that we consider it a great privilege
to die for our country.

872
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:05,242
Very well then. Gentlemen, I shall now retire
until fate has chosen the liberator.

873
01:13:08,705 --> 01:13:11,123
Until then, hail Hynk -

874
01:13:11,208 --> 01:13:13,542
Oh, what am I saying?

875
01:13:13,627 --> 01:13:18,464
Gentlemen, we have pledged our honor.

876
01:13:18,548 --> 01:13:19,757
Proceed.

877
01:16:26,069 --> 01:16:28,737
Gentlemen, the coin is here.

878
01:16:35,161 --> 01:16:36,912
What's the meaning of all this?

879
01:16:36,996 --> 01:16:38,497
Somebody made a fool of us.

880
01:16:38,581 --> 01:16:40,666
- You're quite right. I did.
- What?

881
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,793
I put a coin in every pudding.

882
01:16:45,922 --> 01:16:47,756
Mr. Jaeckel!

883
01:16:47,841 --> 01:16:52,803
Blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people.
We're in enough trouble as it is.

884
01:16:54,097 --> 01:16:57,599
Hannah's right.
We've all been foolish.

885
01:16:57,684 --> 01:17:01,186
Our place is at home,
looking after our own affairs.

886
01:17:01,271 --> 01:17:03,147
Good night.

887
01:17:03,231 --> 01:17:04,731
What's this?

888
01:17:04,816 --> 01:17:06,316
Good night.

889
01:17:10,947 --> 01:17:12,948
Good morning.

890
01:17:24,627 --> 01:17:27,546
By the papers they are saying Commander
Schultz may be hiding in the ghetto.

891
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:29,965
Here it is. Read it for yourself.

892
01:17:31,134 --> 01:17:33,135
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

893
01:17:33,219 --> 01:17:35,345
Hannah, here. Read that.

894
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:37,222
"Mystery still surrounds
the disappearance...

895
01:17:37,307 --> 01:17:38,557
of ex-Commander Schultz.

896
01:17:38,641 --> 01:17:42,186
At police headquarters it was believed that
the commander may be hiding in the ghetto.

897
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:46,190
A certain Jewish barber,
reported to be a friend of Schultz...

898
01:17:46,274 --> 01:17:48,150
is also wanted for questioning. "

899
01:17:48,234 --> 01:17:49,234
Me?

900
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:51,820
Well, if it's just for questioning,
it can't be serious.

901
01:17:51,905 --> 01:17:55,991
Meyerberg was only wanted for questioning,
and we never heard of him since.

902
01:17:56,075 --> 01:17:57,910
Shh!

903
01:18:06,669 --> 01:18:08,754
- Who is it?
- It's me - Mr. Mann.

904
01:18:12,258 --> 01:18:14,718
Hello, Jaeckel. How are you, Mr. Agar?

905
01:18:14,802 --> 01:18:17,095
- How are you, Mrs. Jaeckel?
- How do you do?

906
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,014
Did you hear
what they're saying in the papers...

907
01:18:19,098 --> 01:18:20,766
about Commander Schultz
hiding in the ghetto?

908
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:22,351
Oh, I know, I know.

909
01:18:22,435 --> 01:18:26,021
Well, don't you think that it's serious for you
if they find him here in the house?

910
01:18:26,105 --> 01:18:27,731
Shh!

911
01:18:27,815 --> 01:18:30,484
Don't you realize
there are spies everywhere?

912
01:18:30,568 --> 01:18:32,653
Spies?

913
01:18:36,364 --> 01:18:37,991
What's the matter with him?

914
01:18:38,076 --> 01:18:40,661
Didn't you read
he's wanted for questioning?

915
01:18:40,745 --> 01:18:42,579
Oy.

916
01:18:42,664 --> 01:18:43,997
Where's the commander?

917
01:18:44,082 --> 01:18:46,375
He's in the next room.

918
01:18:46,459 --> 01:18:47,960
Let me tell you.

919
01:18:48,044 --> 01:18:49,920
If Commander Schultz is found
in this house...

920
01:18:50,004 --> 01:18:54,591
we'll all go to the concentration camp for life
and get our heads cut off in the bargain.

921
01:18:54,676 --> 01:18:56,593
Am I giving you an argument?

922
01:18:56,678 --> 01:18:58,220
Then get rid of him.

923
01:18:58,304 --> 01:19:00,013
You can't throw him out.

924
01:19:00,098 --> 01:19:01,640
Of course not.

925
01:19:01,724 --> 01:19:05,477
But I should like to know,
how long is he going to stay here?

926
01:19:05,562 --> 01:19:06,645
That's all.

927
01:19:06,729 --> 01:19:09,147
Come. Your breakfast is on the table.

928
01:19:09,232 --> 01:19:11,984
- Mr. Mann?
- Thank you.

929
01:19:12,068 --> 01:19:13,902
I have breakfast waiting at home.

930
01:19:15,488 --> 01:19:17,781
Take the other side of the street
and search every house.

931
01:19:20,827 --> 01:19:22,369
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

932
01:19:22,453 --> 01:19:24,663
- What's wrong now?
- They're looking for Commander Schultz.

933
01:19:24,747 --> 01:19:27,666
- Commander Schultz?
- He's supposed to be hiding in one of those houses.

934
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:30,085
Oh, they're always looking
for somebody.

935
01:19:43,182 --> 01:19:45,601
- Who is it?
- It's me. Let me in!

936
01:19:45,685 --> 01:19:48,061
- For heaven's sake, hurry up!
- Open the door.

937
01:19:52,609 --> 01:19:54,109
- They're coming this way.
- What?

938
01:19:54,193 --> 01:19:56,695
The storm troopers are searching
every house.

939
01:19:56,779 --> 01:19:58,363
Quick! Tell the commander.

940
01:20:05,538 --> 01:20:07,039
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

941
01:20:07,123 --> 01:20:09,541
- What is it?
- The storm troopers, they're going to search the house.

942
01:20:09,626 --> 01:20:12,544
- What?
- You'd better get up on the roof. Quick! Both of you!

943
01:20:14,005 --> 01:20:15,297
Wait a minute!

944
01:20:15,381 --> 01:20:18,717
- We can't leave all these things about.
- That's right. All of you, pack my valises.

945
01:20:20,637 --> 01:20:22,346
You pack this valise.

946
01:20:31,064 --> 01:20:33,231
- Clear this shelf. Quickly.
- Oh, yes.

947
01:20:35,818 --> 01:20:37,903
Pack this and this.

948
01:20:37,987 --> 01:20:40,906
Oh, this mustn't be found here.
Open the door.

949
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:50,165
Listen! They are here!
Get up on the roof. Quick!

950
01:20:50,249 --> 01:20:53,001
- I'll take this.
- Be sure they don't leave anything behind.

951
01:20:53,086 --> 01:20:55,087
- My golf clubs.
- The hatbox!

952
01:20:58,257 --> 01:21:00,509
- Here. Take this.
- Come on! Let's hurry!

953
01:21:00,593 --> 01:21:02,177
- Where are you going?
- I'm going with him.

954
01:21:02,261 --> 01:21:04,054
You stay here. You'll see him later.
Here. Take this.

955
01:21:04,138 --> 01:21:06,014
- I'll meet you on the roof tonight.
- All right.

956
01:21:06,099 --> 01:21:07,599
Oh, take this.

957
01:21:11,854 --> 01:21:13,772
Come on. Quick! Come on.

958
01:21:13,856 --> 01:21:16,858
Open in the name of Hynkel!

959
01:21:23,574 --> 01:21:25,575
Stop!

960
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:27,786
- Look where you are.
- Look where?

961
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:29,496
Look where you are.

962
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:31,707
Wait, I can't - I can't see.
Wait a moment.

963
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:36,378
- My bag! You've dropped it!
- No, it's right here. Here it is.

964
01:21:43,344 --> 01:21:46,054
Don't drop the other one!
Don't drop the other one!

965
01:21:46,139 --> 01:21:49,474
My golf clubs! Not my golf clubs!

966
01:21:50,143 --> 01:21:52,102
Come off of there. They'll see you.

967
01:21:53,479 --> 01:21:55,814
Quick! This way!

968
01:22:01,195 --> 01:22:03,321
Whoa! Steady!

969
01:22:03,406 --> 01:22:05,365
Now be careful.

970
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:06,783
Yes, sir.

971
01:22:06,868 --> 01:22:08,910
You were lucky
you didn't break your neck.

972
01:22:08,995 --> 01:22:10,328
Yes, sir.

973
01:22:14,667 --> 01:22:16,168
You'll pardon me.

974
01:22:19,255 --> 01:22:20,338
Sorry.

975
01:22:22,675 --> 01:22:25,302
You guard the back -
Wait a minute.

976
01:22:25,386 --> 01:22:27,345
I'm sorry.
I shall have to bother you again.

977
01:22:28,598 --> 01:22:30,098
There he is!

978
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,313
Well, good morning. How are you?

979
01:22:36,397 --> 01:22:38,190
Oh, so-so.

980
01:22:38,274 --> 01:22:40,066
Commander Schultz, who's your friend?

981
01:22:40,151 --> 01:22:42,444
Remember, your silence
will be appreciated.

982
01:22:42,528 --> 01:22:44,196
- Yes, sir.
- Take him down to the wagon.

983
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:45,447
Come on.

984
01:22:58,294 --> 01:23:00,629
- Hey! Where you going?
- To the smoking room.

985
01:23:00,713 --> 01:23:02,881
Ah, come on! Down this way!

986
01:23:52,348 --> 01:23:53,849
Osterlich.

987
01:23:53,933 --> 01:23:54,933
<i>Ja.</i>

988
01:25:28,027 --> 01:25:29,694
Gentlemen, I am pleased to announce...

989
01:25:29,779 --> 01:25:33,281
that we are at last
ready to march on Osterlich.

990
01:25:33,366 --> 01:25:36,117
This was made possible
by the enterprise and genius...

991
01:25:36,202 --> 01:25:38,203
of Field Marshal Herring...

992
01:25:38,287 --> 01:25:41,122
upon whom I shall now pin
a token of my regard.

993
01:25:46,128 --> 01:25:49,049
<i>...der Wiener schnitzel...</i>

994
01:25:59,999 --> 01:26:01,558
...da genius.

995
01:26:05,898 --> 01:26:08,900
Turn around. No. Ah, yes.

996
01:26:21,664 --> 01:26:23,164
Gentlemen...

997
01:26:24,834 --> 01:26:27,419
to Field Marshal Herring.

998
01:26:27,503 --> 01:26:29,421
To the invasion of Osterlich.

999
01:26:46,188 --> 01:26:47,188
Elephant.

1000
01:26:49,442 --> 01:26:52,694
Hello? Yes. Yes.

1001
01:26:52,778 --> 01:26:53,778
Wait.

1002
01:26:53,863 --> 01:26:56,114
Napaloni's mobilized his army
on the Osterlich front.

1003
01:26:56,198 --> 01:26:57,615
What?

1004
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:00,118
Already 60,000 men are on the border.

1005
01:27:00,202 --> 01:27:01,703
He's going to take Osterlich!

1006
01:27:01,787 --> 01:27:03,580
I can't believe it.

1007
01:27:05,624 --> 01:27:08,251
You can't believe it?

1008
01:27:08,335 --> 01:27:10,962
But, Your Excellency, I -

1009
01:27:11,047 --> 01:27:13,006
- You let him steal a march on us!
- No, I -

1010
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:15,592
You can't believe it?

1011
01:27:15,676 --> 01:27:20,138
I did everything that was -

1012
01:27:20,222 --> 01:27:23,975
I had the ground covered.

1013
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:33,818
Haven't you any brains?

1014
01:27:33,903 --> 01:27:35,820
<i>..."pinheaden"...</i>

1015
01:27:46,082 --> 01:27:47,749
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1016
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:50,001
No, no, no, no, no!

1017
01:27:51,087 --> 01:27:53,421
No, no - No!

1018
01:27:53,506 --> 01:27:55,840
- Declare war on Napaloni!
- Napaloni?

1019
01:27:55,925 --> 01:28:00,261
Yes, Napaloni! Listen, you blockhead! Mobilize
every division of the army and the air force.

1020
01:28:00,346 --> 01:28:03,264
- Proceed to Bacteria and attack at once!
- But war will be the end of us.

1021
01:28:03,349 --> 01:28:04,516
- Do as I tell you.
- Madness.

1022
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,351
- Shut up!
- Very well. Will you sign this?

1023
01:28:06,435 --> 01:28:08,686
- Yes, I'll - What is it?
- A declaration of war.

1024
01:28:08,771 --> 01:28:10,438
I'll sign it. A pen.

1025
01:28:10,523 --> 01:28:12,941
I'll sign it.

1026
01:28:18,864 --> 01:28:20,115
A pen!

1027
01:28:20,199 --> 01:28:22,367
I'll sign it! Napaloni.

1028
01:28:22,451 --> 01:28:25,203
<i>Der grosser peanut!
Der cheesy ravioli!</i>

1029
01:28:25,287 --> 01:28:26,830
There!

1030
01:28:26,914 --> 01:28:28,581
Hello?

1031
01:28:28,666 --> 01:28:30,708
- It's Napaloni.
- Wait a minute.

1032
01:28:30,793 --> 01:28:32,710
Napaloni?

1033
01:28:32,795 --> 01:28:35,463
- You talk to him.
- What shall I say?

1034
01:28:35,548 --> 01:28:38,133
Be nice, affable, pleasant.

1035
01:28:41,262 --> 01:28:42,303
Hello?

1036
01:28:42,388 --> 01:28:44,806
Well, well, well. How are you?

1037
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:46,683
Fine.

1038
01:28:46,767 --> 01:28:49,561
No, he hasn't been playing
very much lately.

1039
01:28:49,645 --> 01:28:51,980
You went around in '92? Really?

1040
01:28:53,899 --> 01:28:56,025
You want to speak to His Excellency?

1041
01:29:00,906 --> 01:29:02,991
Just now he's a little hoarse.

1042
01:29:03,075 --> 01:29:07,370
Hmm. No, no. I mean he can't talk.

1043
01:29:07,454 --> 01:29:09,622
May I take a message?

1044
01:29:10,374 --> 01:29:13,585
He says no doubt you've heard of the movement
of his troops on the Osterlich front...

1045
01:29:13,669 --> 01:29:15,170
and he'd like to discuss
the matter with you.

1046
01:29:15,254 --> 01:29:16,963
Ask him to come here.

1047
01:29:17,047 --> 01:29:19,340
His Excellency would be delighted
to invite you to Tomainia...

1048
01:29:19,425 --> 01:29:21,217
where you could discuss the matter.

1049
01:29:22,344 --> 01:29:25,013
Very well.
I'll make the necessary arrangements.

1050
01:29:25,097 --> 01:29:27,015
Good-bye, Your Excellency.

1051
01:29:27,099 --> 01:29:28,349
He's coming.

1052
01:29:28,434 --> 01:29:30,852
Good. We'll give him the works.

1053
01:29:30,936 --> 01:29:33,271
We'll put on the greatest military show
the world has ever known!

1054
01:29:33,355 --> 01:29:37,567
Convinced of my strength, Napaloni will
leave the invasion of Osterlich to me.

1055
01:29:39,028 --> 01:29:40,528
What shall I do with this?

1056
01:29:40,613 --> 01:29:42,822
- What is it?
- Your declaration of war.

1057
01:29:45,993 --> 01:29:48,119
Peace is declared.

1058
01:29:50,539 --> 01:29:54,959
<i>2,975,000 eager citizens
are massed in the station square...</i>

1059
01:29:55,044 --> 01:29:57,629
<i>awaiting the arrival
of Benzino Napaloni.</i>

1060

<i>Entering the station is our beloved Phooey,
ready to greet his distinguished guest.</i>

1061
01:30:01,884 --> 01:30:03,968
<i>This historic meeting
will cement a friendship...</i>

1062
01:30:04,053 --> 01:30:08,056
<i>that has long existed between our Phooey
and the dictator of Bacteria.</i>

1063
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:09,474

1064
01:30:09,558 --> 01:30:12,977
<i>His Excellency is about to greet
the Bacterian ambassador.</i>

1065
01:30:13,062 --> 01:30:15,146
- How do you do?
- Thank you, sir.

1066
01:30:16,315 --> 01:30:17,565
Garbitsch.

1067
01:30:19,401 --> 01:30:21,152
See about the photography.

1068
01:30:22,821 --> 01:30:24,405
When Their Excellencies meet...

1069
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:26,783
tell the press to see that our Phooey
is well-photographed.

1070
01:30:26,867 --> 01:30:28,660
- Full face, not the back of his head.
- Yes, sir.

1071
01:30:28,744 --> 01:30:31,996
<i>Benzino Napaloni's private train
is now coming into the station.</i>

<i>And from a pink and white car...</i>

1073
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:37,085
<i>- Napaloni and his wife will step onto a crimson carpet...
- Present arms!</i>

1074

<i>where Adenoid Hynkel will deliver
his address of welcome.</i>

1075
01:30:51,517 --> 01:30:53,184
What's the matter with this stupid -

1076
01:30:54,436 --> 01:30:56,104
Hey! What's all of this mix-up ?

1077
01:30:56,188 --> 01:30:58,022
Come on. They've gone too far.

1078
01:30:59,525 --> 01:31:02,443
At ease! Bring along the carpet.

1079
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,696
Papa, why can't we get out here?

1080
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:07,448
- There is no carpet.
- Who cares about a carpet?

1081
01:31:07,533 --> 01:31:11,035
Il Dig-a-Ditchy, me, Napaloni.
I never get out without a carpet.

1082
01:31:16,709 --> 01:31:19,252
Come on.
Lay it down here. Quick.

1083
01:31:19,336 --> 01:31:20,795
- Hurry up!
- It's going back again!

1084
01:31:20,879 --> 01:31:22,005
What?

1085
01:31:25,301 --> 01:31:28,428
What do you do? You salami?

1086
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:33,057
Let's get out!
Let's get out while it's stopping!

1087
01:31:33,142 --> 01:31:34,559
Shut up!

1088
01:31:38,272 --> 01:31:40,440
Hurry. Quick. Put it down.

1089
01:31:41,734 --> 01:31:43,609
Take it away. Take it away.

1090
01:31:43,694 --> 01:31:47,155
Stay here. Stay here
until they've made up their mind.

1091
01:31:52,453 --> 01:31:55,246
You got the carpet?
Well, put 'em down!

1092
01:31:56,081 --> 01:31:58,166
Hmm. Oh, come on, come on.

1093
01:32:01,587 --> 01:32:03,504
Here he is.

1094
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,424
- My friend!
- Napaloni!

1095
01:32:09,511 --> 01:32:11,846
- This is indeed a pleasure.
- Thank you.

1096
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:15,141
Welcome to Tomainia. This way.

1097
01:32:15,225 --> 01:32:16,601
Pictures, Your Excellencies?

1098
01:32:16,685 --> 01:32:19,020
Oh, sure. Salute!

1099
01:32:19,104 --> 01:32:20,605
Another one, please.

1100
01:32:20,689 --> 01:32:23,107
Ah, this is really a pleasure
to be here, my friend Hynkel.

1101
01:32:23,859 --> 01:32:25,943
Oh, you want another picture?
Just a moment.

1102
01:32:26,028 --> 01:32:27,028
There.

1103
01:32:32,034 --> 01:32:34,285
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- My bambino!

1104
01:32:34,370 --> 01:32:36,329
- All right. It's all right, Mama.
- Get rid of those men.

1105
01:32:36,413 --> 01:32:37,538
- Where is my ambassador?
- Dismissed.

1106
01:32:37,623 --> 01:32:39,374
- There you are. Hello, Spook.
- Your Excellency.

1107
01:32:39,458 --> 01:32:42,210
How do you feel?
Good! Look after Mama.

1108
01:32:42,294 --> 01:32:44,045
Oh, Hynkie, did you meet my wife?

1109
01:32:44,129 --> 01:32:45,254
- Your wife?
- That's her.

1110
01:32:45,339 --> 01:32:46,339
- I -
- Let's go.

1111
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,718
Tomainia! Very nice. Very nice.

1112
01:32:52,471 --> 01:32:54,847
Present... arms!

1113
01:32:54,932 --> 01:32:58,726
Napaloni! Napaloni!

1114
01:33:10,406 --> 01:33:12,198
Clock is two minutes slow.

1115
01:33:12,908 --> 01:33:14,325
This way.

1116
01:33:27,923 --> 01:33:31,592
Napaloni! Napaloni!

1117
01:33:31,677 --> 01:33:33,177
Napaloni!

1118
01:33:38,183 --> 01:33:40,435
It's very nice people.

1119
01:33:40,519 --> 01:33:44,272
- I say, the people are very nice.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

1120
01:33:46,191 --> 01:33:47,692
- He is my husband!
- Keep back!

1121
01:33:47,776 --> 01:33:48,943
- You make a mistake!
- Let me go!

1122
01:33:49,027 --> 01:33:50,695
- You make a big mistake!
- Get back!

1123
01:33:50,779 --> 01:33:51,988
Please!

1124
01:33:53,991 --> 01:33:56,200
At all costs, Napaloni shall not
invade Osterlich.

1125
01:33:56,285 --> 01:33:57,869
That country belongs to me.

1126
01:33:57,953 --> 01:34:01,080
At this meeting we shall not
discuss the Osterlich situation.

1127
01:34:01,165 --> 01:34:04,542
This interview is solely to impress upon him
the force of your personality.

1128
01:34:04,626 --> 01:34:07,795
- Hmm.
- To make him feel your superiority.

1129
01:34:09,256 --> 01:34:11,424
This man Napaloni
is aggressive, domineering.

1130
01:34:11,508 --> 01:34:13,801
Before we make our demands,
we must put him in his place.

1131
01:34:13,886 --> 01:34:16,804
- Precisely. But how?
- By means of applied psychology.

1132
01:34:16,889 --> 01:34:19,724
In other words,
by making him feel inferior.

1133
01:34:19,808 --> 01:34:21,809
This can be done in many subtle ways.

1134
01:34:21,894 --> 01:34:24,979
For instance, at this interview,
I have so arranged...

1135
01:34:25,063 --> 01:34:27,440
that he will always be
looking up at you...

1136
01:34:27,524 --> 01:34:29,150
you looking down at him.

1137
01:34:29,234 --> 01:34:31,777
At all times his position
will be inferior.

1138
01:34:31,862 --> 01:34:33,654
Mmm. Excellent.

1139
01:34:33,739 --> 01:34:37,909
Then again, we shall seat him here
beside your bust...

1140
01:34:37,993 --> 01:34:41,412
so that if you relax,
that will always be glaring at him.

1141
01:34:41,497 --> 01:34:43,831
And?

1142
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:45,374
Where is he now?

1143
01:34:45,459 --> 01:34:48,294
Resting.
When he arrives, I have arranged...

1144
01:34:48,378 --> 01:34:51,255
that he shall enter
from the far end of the room.

1145
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:53,591
Another psychological triumph.

1146
01:34:53,675 --> 01:34:57,094
He will have the embarrassment of walking
the entire length of the floor toward you.

1147
01:34:57,179 --> 01:34:59,555
Very good.

1148
01:35:01,892 --> 01:35:03,184
Yes?

1149
01:35:03,268 --> 01:35:06,020
<i>His Excellency
Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room.</i>

1150
01:35:06,104 --> 01:35:09,607
He's coming! He's coming!
Quick, get me a flower. A flower.

1151
01:35:09,691 --> 01:35:11,943
Remember, at all times you must be
above him, before him.

1152
01:35:12,027 --> 01:35:13,945
Entering or leaving,
you must be first.

1153
01:35:20,369 --> 01:35:22,537
Hello, Hynkie!

1154
01:35:22,621 --> 01:35:26,457
<i>Wie Gootz! Wie geht's!</i>

1155
01:35:26,542 --> 01:35:28,501
How you feel?

1156
01:35:31,964 --> 01:35:34,882
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Ah, my brother dictator!

1157
01:35:35,676 --> 01:35:37,635
You are a nice little man, Hynkie!

1158
01:35:37,719 --> 01:35:41,305
I'm so glad to see you again.

1159
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:43,975
And my friend the Garbitsch!
Hello!

1160
01:35:45,143 --> 01:35:47,562
Ah, this is a lovely place.

1161
01:35:47,646 --> 01:35:50,648
I feel fine.
I just had a nice cold shower.

1162
01:35:50,732 --> 01:35:54,694
And that bathtub - as soon as you get
the plumbing fixed, it'll be in good shape.

1163
01:35:56,071 --> 01:35:57,905
Your Excellency, won't you sit down.

1164
01:35:57,990 --> 01:35:59,490
Oh, shoot, shoot.

1165
01:36:20,971 --> 01:36:24,140
Well, Hynkie, my dictator friend, you -

1166
01:36:29,271 --> 01:36:30,855
I must be growing.

1167
01:36:32,524 --> 01:36:34,692
Not sure why they gave me
a baby stool.

1168
01:36:43,368 --> 01:36:46,704
This stool is not for me.
I like it better up-stairs here.

1169
01:36:46,788 --> 01:36:48,914
You know something, Garbitsch?
This is a lovely country.

1170
01:36:48,999 --> 01:36:50,458
Very nice people.

1171
01:36:50,542 --> 01:36:52,960
I thought the public extremely enthusiastic
on your arrival.

1172
01:36:53,045 --> 01:36:55,379
Sure. They like to see new faces.

1173
01:36:58,884 --> 01:37:02,595
I'm sorry for the mishap that occurred
to Madam Napaloni at the railroad station.

1174
01:37:02,679 --> 01:37:04,513
What's that? What's that?

1175
01:37:04,598 --> 01:37:08,559
I'm sorry for the Napaloni
that occurred at the - at the rail -

1176
01:37:09,394 --> 01:37:11,646
Madam Napaloni at the railway station.

1177
01:37:12,397 --> 01:37:15,816
Oh, she's not used to public life.
She can't take it.

1178
01:37:15,901 --> 01:37:16,984
Match.

1179
01:37:17,069 --> 01:37:18,819
Oh - I'm sorry. I'm -

1180
01:37:18,904 --> 01:37:22,406
No, that's all right.
Don't apologize. I find one.

1181
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:27,411
I am simply crazy about this palace.

1182
01:37:27,496 --> 01:37:30,414
Ivory and gold -
that makes a lovely combination.

1183
01:37:30,499 --> 01:37:33,918
Gets away from that gingerbread idea.
Say, tell me something, Garbitsch.

1184
01:37:35,003 --> 01:37:36,504
What's on the program?

1185
01:37:36,588 --> 01:37:38,839
- There's the grand ball this evening.
- Grand ball?

1186
01:37:38,924 --> 01:37:42,009
The grand ball. And this afternoon,
a review of the army.

1187
01:37:42,094 --> 01:37:44,053
Review of the army?
Well, that won't take long.

1188
01:37:44,137 --> 01:37:47,598
- I'm afraid it will.
- Oh? So you got a big army, huh?

1189
01:37:47,683 --> 01:37:50,017
Modesty forbids.

1190
01:37:50,936 --> 01:37:52,687
Yes, seems I've heard
something about it.

1191
01:37:52,771 --> 01:37:55,106
If I'm gonna review the army,
I think I'll get me a shave.

1192
01:37:55,190 --> 01:37:57,692
- We have a barbershop in the palace.
- Is that so?

1193
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:00,986
Hynkie, you look a little blue
under the gills.

1194
01:38:01,071 --> 01:38:03,948
- What do you say we take a shave together?
- I should be delighted.

1195
01:38:04,032 --> 01:38:05,991
- Good!
- Very well. This way.

1196
01:38:15,877 --> 01:38:18,379
Ah, this is the barbershop.
I can smell 'em.

1197
01:38:26,138 --> 01:38:28,055
Ah, now this is sweet,
very sweet.

1198
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:30,808
- Do you like it? It was the emperor's library.
- Makes a good barbershop.

1199
01:38:30,892 --> 01:38:33,144
- Too old fashioned. I want something modern.
- Is that so?

1200
01:38:33,228 --> 01:38:36,313
You see, when I get shaved, I'm very nervous.
I like something to look at.

1201
01:38:36,398 --> 01:38:38,399
So I'm putting in glass walls and ceiling...

1202
01:38:38,483 --> 01:38:41,318
so that when my head is turned this way,
I shall have a view of the mountains.

1203
01:38:42,195 --> 01:38:44,822
And when it's tipped this way,
I shall have a view through the glass ceiling.

1204
01:38:44,906 --> 01:38:46,699
- What's above the ceiling?
- The ballroom.

1205
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:51,412
Then in my summer palace
I have a barbershop.

1206
01:38:53,248 --> 01:38:55,541
Is that so?

1207
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:57,042
Yes.

1208
01:38:57,127 --> 01:38:59,170
That also has glass walls.

1209
01:38:59,254 --> 01:39:00,755
You don't tell me.

1210
01:39:00,839 --> 01:39:04,091
Oh, yes.
With goldfish swimming inside.

1211
01:39:04,176 --> 01:39:06,093
Wait a minute.
Goldfish swimming inside the walls?

1212
01:39:06,178 --> 01:39:07,845
- Mm-hmm.
- How do you feed 'em?

1213
01:39:07,929 --> 01:39:11,432
You can't. They're all dead.
That's why I'm building a new barbershop.

1214
01:39:14,352 --> 01:39:16,937
- Very interesting. Very interesting.
- Yes? Do you like it?

1215
01:39:21,943 --> 01:39:23,527
<i>This is the Hynkel Stadium.</i>

1216
01:39:23,612 --> 01:39:27,448
<i>Before a half million spectators, the greatest
display of arms the world has ever known...</i>

1217
01:39:27,532 --> 01:39:29,533
<i>marches by in review.</i>

1218
01:39:29,618 --> 01:39:31,619
<i>Our beloved Phooey
and Il Dig-a-Ditchy are seated...</i>

1219
01:39:31,703 --> 01:39:34,914
<i>in the reviewing stand,
thrilled by this historic event.</i>

1220
01:39:35,916 --> 01:39:36,916
What?

1221
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,626
Nothing. I'm just chewing.

1222
01:39:40,462 --> 01:39:42,379
- Ah, yes.
- Would you care for some peanuts?

1223
01:39:43,465 --> 01:39:46,801
- Thank you. I've had some.
- Oh. Good shape. Here you are, Spook.

1224
01:39:46,885 --> 01:39:49,136
<i>Now passing -
Tomainia's heavy artillery.</i>

1225
01:39:50,972 --> 01:39:52,473
It's all right.

1226
01:39:52,557 --> 01:39:56,352
I want to show you my new bombing planes.
I just called up a half hour ago to start 'em over.

1227
01:39:56,436 --> 01:39:58,062
- Where are they coming from?
- Aroma.

1228
01:39:58,146 --> 01:39:59,814
Aroma? That's 400 miles away.

1229
01:39:59,898 --> 01:40:02,525
That's right. They should be here now.
I don't know what's detaining them.

1230
01:40:02,609 --> 01:40:05,361
<i>Now passing -
Tomainia's light artillery.</i>

1231
01:40:10,158 --> 01:40:12,159
Hmm. That's very light.

1232
01:40:12,244 --> 01:40:14,078
<i>And here come the armored tanks...</i>

1233
01:40:14,162 --> 01:40:15,996
<i>the pride of Tomainia's army.</i>

1234
01:40:16,081 --> 01:40:19,416
<i>The latest design,
the last word in modern warfare.</i>

1235
01:40:20,418 --> 01:40:22,503
Wait a minute.
Where's the propellers?

1236
01:40:22,587 --> 01:40:24,755
- Propellers?
- Sure. For going under the water.

1237
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:26,841
- Tanks that go under the water?
- Submarine work!

1238
01:40:26,925 --> 01:40:30,594
You never heard of aero-marine tanks that
go under the water and then fly up-stairs?

1239
01:40:30,679 --> 01:40:33,681
- What's that?
- Tanks that go under the water and fly in the air.

1240
01:40:33,765 --> 01:40:35,933
Oh, yes. Those are obsolete now.

1241
01:40:36,017 --> 01:40:38,269
We're concentrating
on flying dreadnoughts.

1242
01:40:38,353 --> 01:40:40,729
Flying dreadnoughts.

1243
01:40:45,861 --> 01:40:47,486
- What's that?
- My planes!

1244
01:40:47,571 --> 01:40:50,948
<i>Now passing -
Hynkel's flying division number 34.</i>

1245
01:40:51,032 --> 01:40:52,616
Our planes!

1246
01:40:57,956 --> 01:41:00,332
You're right. They're yours.

1247
01:41:25,483 --> 01:41:26,650
Ah, Garbitsch.

1248
01:41:27,819 --> 01:41:29,737
The invasion of Osterlich.

1249
01:41:29,821 --> 01:41:33,908
It's all so simple. Our troops, tanks
and guns will be hidden along the border.

1250
01:41:33,992 --> 01:41:36,994
To disarm suspicion, you will go hunting -
duck shooting or something.

1251
01:41:37,078 --> 01:41:39,747
At the appointed time, you will show up
at the village of Pretzelberg...

1252
01:41:39,831 --> 01:41:43,667
meet the army, step into an automobile
and cross over into Osterlich.

1253
01:41:43,752 --> 01:41:46,670
Herring and I will be waiting
at the capital to receive you.

1254
01:41:46,755 --> 01:41:49,089
First, Napaloni must remove
his troops from the border.

1255
01:41:49,174 --> 01:41:50,758
That question will be decided tonight.

1256
01:41:50,842 --> 01:41:52,301
Where is Napaloni?

1257
01:41:52,385 --> 01:41:54,470
I'll see if I can find him.
In the meantime...

1258
01:41:54,554 --> 01:41:57,348
it might be advisable for you
to dance with Madam Napaloni.

1259
01:41:59,017 --> 01:42:00,476
It'll carry weight.

1260
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,186
You mean I will carry weight.

1261
01:42:06,232 --> 01:42:08,025
You find him. Let me know at once.

1262
01:42:13,448 --> 01:42:16,617
- Madam Napaloni.
- Your Excellency.

1263
01:42:16,701 --> 01:42:19,119
Why so triste?

1264
01:42:19,204 --> 01:42:21,038
'Cause I no speak.

1265
01:42:21,122 --> 01:42:23,290
No? May I have the pleasure
of this dance?

1266
01:42:23,375 --> 01:42:24,667
Oh, yes.

1267
01:42:24,751 --> 01:42:26,251
Allow me.

1268
01:42:57,075 --> 01:43:00,327
Madam, your dancing was superb.

1269
01:43:00,412 --> 01:43:01,704
Excellent.

1270
01:43:01,788 --> 01:43:03,288
Very good.

1271
01:43:03,373 --> 01:43:04,623
Good.

1272
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:19,430
- Ah, my dear Adenoid!
- Benzino!

1273
01:43:19,514 --> 01:43:22,266
I've been looking for you all evening.
What do you say we have a sandwich...

1274
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:25,728
go to some quiet little place where we can
sit down and talk things over, huh?

1275
01:43:25,812 --> 01:43:29,273
- As you wish.
- An excellent idea! Gentlemen, to the buffet.

1276
01:43:29,357 --> 01:43:31,025
Of course. This way.

1277
01:43:49,461 --> 01:43:51,128
There's an old Tomainian proverb.

1278
01:43:56,051 --> 01:43:59,303
That's very funny! I wish I understand it.

1279
01:43:59,387 --> 01:44:00,929
Now, about the border situation.

1280
01:44:01,014 --> 01:44:03,223
- Ah, yes, yes. No problem.
- Oh, it should be no trouble at all.

1281
01:44:03,308 --> 01:44:04,475
- Shh, shh.
- Not at all.

1282
01:44:04,559 --> 01:44:05,726
- What's the matter?
- Wait.

1283
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:07,811
Out!

1284
01:44:10,315 --> 01:44:12,399
You two, out!

1285
01:44:16,780 --> 01:44:17,780
Out.

1286
01:44:20,658 --> 01:44:23,077
- Out?
- Out.

1287
01:44:23,161 --> 01:44:24,495
Out?

1288
01:44:25,497 --> 01:44:26,663
Out.

1289
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:32,169
As I was saying, about the border question.

1290
01:44:32,253 --> 01:44:35,714
- Ah, yes, yes, yes.
- Just a matter of detail. Mere formalities.

1291
01:44:35,799 --> 01:44:36,882
Strawberries.

1292
01:44:36,966 --> 01:44:38,634
Pardon me.
Have you English mustard?

1293
01:44:38,718 --> 01:44:40,761
- English mustard, Your Excellency.
- That's the hot stuff?

1294
01:44:40,845 --> 01:44:42,304
- Very hot.
- Ah, good shape, good shape.

1295
01:44:42,388 --> 01:44:44,223
- Cream.
- Cream, Your Excellency.

1296
01:44:44,307 --> 01:44:47,518
Now, Hynkie, as far as I'm concerned,
I'm gonna make this very simple.

1297
01:44:47,602 --> 01:44:50,521
This is the treaty -
You agree not to invade Osterlich...

1298
01:44:50,605 --> 01:44:52,231
I agree not to invade Osterlich.

1299
01:44:52,315 --> 01:44:55,109
We sign the treaty,
then I remove my troops from the border.

1300
01:44:55,193 --> 01:44:57,361
Good. In other words, when your troops
are off the border, I sign.

1301
01:44:57,445 --> 01:44:58,612
- That's right.
- Very good.

1302
01:44:58,696 --> 01:45:02,199
Oh, just a minute.
You don't understand.

1303
01:45:02,283 --> 01:45:05,369
First we sign the treaty,
then I remove the troops.

1304
01:45:05,453 --> 01:45:07,538
Precisely. I sign when your troops
are off the border.

1305
01:45:07,622 --> 01:45:10,457
Just a minute.
Hey, Spook, treaty.

1306
01:45:11,292 --> 01:45:12,584
Hold this.

1307
01:45:12,669 --> 01:45:14,128
Now, look.

1308
01:45:14,212 --> 01:45:16,380
You sign this treaty first...

1309
01:45:16,464 --> 01:45:18,841
then I remove the troops after.

1310
01:45:18,925 --> 01:45:21,885
- Well, what are we arguing about?
- You just said I remove the troops first.

1311
01:45:21,970 --> 01:45:24,388
You don't expect me to sign
while your troops are there on the border?

1312
01:45:24,472 --> 01:45:26,598
You don't expect me to remove
the troops until you sign?

1313
01:45:26,683 --> 01:45:27,724
- Why not?
- Why should I?

1314
01:45:27,809 --> 01:45:29,726
- Why shouldn't you? Osterlich is a free country.
- So?

1315
01:45:29,811 --> 01:45:31,979
Your soldiers are there,
on the Osterlich border!

1316
01:45:32,063 --> 01:45:34,439
And they'll stay there
until you sign this treaty!

1317
01:45:34,524 --> 01:45:36,817
You'll take them off, or I'll blow them off!

1318
01:45:36,901 --> 01:45:38,735
Gentlemen, this won't get us anywhere.

1319
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:41,071
Your Excellency, to quote
an old Latin phrase -

1320
01:45:42,866 --> 01:45:44,575
He's right! Speak to him!

1321
01:45:44,659 --> 01:45:45,659
Strawberries.

1322
01:45:45,743 --> 01:45:47,995
Where's my sandwich?
Well, give me another one!

1323
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:50,330
- Can't we sit down and discuss this -
- I'm a guest here.

1324
01:45:50,415 --> 01:45:52,583
Nobody talk to me in my own joint
like that!

1325
01:45:52,667 --> 01:45:55,043
Can't we sit down and discuss this thing
without passion?

1326
01:45:55,128 --> 01:45:57,504
I am not passionate.
I am just, that's all.

1327
01:45:57,589 --> 01:46:00,090
I want him to sign the treaty.
I'll remove the troops.

1328
01:46:00,175 --> 01:46:02,634
Can't you understand?
What would my people think...

1329
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:06,180
signing such a treaty when your soldiers
are there on the Osterlich border?

1330
01:46:06,264 --> 01:46:08,307
I will not move soldiers
until you sign!

1331
01:46:08,391 --> 01:46:11,268
Not until you clear that border
will I sign anything.

1332
01:46:11,352 --> 01:46:13,687
- Then my soldiers remain!
- Then I kick them off!

1333
01:46:13,771 --> 01:46:17,608
One move from you, Hynkie, and my artillery
take like this and blow you to pieces!

1334
01:46:17,692 --> 01:46:21,403
Yes, and my aeroplanes will bomb
your artillery like that!

1335
01:46:21,487 --> 01:46:23,530
You want to start a world war?
I'll get you one!

1336
01:46:23,615 --> 01:46:25,866
You and the world!
I'll throw in the ocean!

1337
01:46:25,950 --> 01:46:27,284
- Mmm!
- Gentlemen, please!

1338
01:46:39,297 --> 01:46:43,842
I'm coming home!
I cannot talk to this ignoramus!

1339
01:46:43,927 --> 01:46:44,885
Strawberries!

1340
01:46:44,969 --> 01:46:47,304
Your Excellency,
we have a very important position...

1341
01:46:47,388 --> 01:46:49,139
that I must urge upon you.

1342
01:46:49,224 --> 01:46:51,642
I know what you must -

1343
01:46:54,896 --> 01:46:58,690
If you would -

1344
01:47:07,075 --> 01:47:08,909
What's wrong?

1345
01:47:08,993 --> 01:47:11,495
I don't give a hoopy!
I got my guns here in the pass!

1346
01:47:11,579 --> 01:47:14,164
If he start something,
I'll blow him to "passes!"

1347
01:47:18,253 --> 01:47:20,921
Excellency, what's the matter?
What ails you? What has -

1348
01:47:21,005 --> 01:47:24,091
- Your Excellency, this isn't like you.
- Hey! What is the matter?

1349
01:47:24,175 --> 01:47:25,926
Hey, Garbitsch, come here!

1350
01:47:26,010 --> 01:47:27,678
What is the matter with Hynkie?

1351
01:47:27,762 --> 01:47:29,429
He's put mustard on his strawberries.

1352
01:47:29,514 --> 01:47:32,432
Mustard -
What else can you expect from Hynkie?

1353
01:47:36,688 --> 01:47:38,105
Il Dig-a-Ditchy!

1354
01:47:38,189 --> 01:47:39,940
What? What's the matter? What?

1355
01:47:40,024 --> 01:47:43,235
My little bambino!

1356
01:47:56,624 --> 01:47:58,375
...the Bacterian -
... Tomainia -

1357
01:48:00,295 --> 01:48:02,713
You cannot treat
the Bacterian people this way!

1358
01:48:02,797 --> 01:48:06,383
I'll take the Bacterian people
and I'll tear them apart like this!

1359
01:48:06,467 --> 01:48:08,677
- Excellency, please!
- Look! Look what he's doing!

1360
01:48:08,761 --> 01:48:12,389
It's an insult to my people!

1361
01:48:12,473 --> 01:48:15,017
Look, he's pulling spaghetti!
The spaghetti!

1362
01:48:15,101 --> 01:48:17,352
He either sign the treaty,
or we have a war!

1363
01:48:17,437 --> 01:48:18,937
- Ooh!
- Listen! Listen!

1364
01:48:19,022 --> 01:48:22,190
Give me something! Quick!
Give me something! I want to -

1365
01:48:25,903 --> 01:48:28,405
- But it's all right. I have an appointment.
- What's this?

1366
01:48:28,489 --> 01:48:31,033
I'm from the international press.
How's the conference progressing?

1367
01:48:31,117 --> 01:48:33,910
Very successfully. How did you get in?
Excuse me, will you?

1368
01:48:35,163 --> 01:48:37,331
How did this man get in here?

1369
01:48:37,415 --> 01:48:40,667
You know the regulations of the palace in
regard to reporters. Go down to Captain Block.

1370
01:48:40,752 --> 01:48:43,337
Tell him not to allow anyone else to enter
the palace under any circumstances tonight.

1371
01:48:43,421 --> 01:48:45,464
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

1372
01:48:48,676 --> 01:48:52,179
Of course, there are minor details
to be cleaned up, things that you must -

1373
01:48:53,431 --> 01:48:55,098
Excuse me. We're very busy.

1374
01:48:59,854 --> 01:49:01,980
- Oh!
- Gentlemen, please!

1375
01:49:02,065 --> 01:49:04,483
The press are outside. The whole world
will know that we're fighting.

1376
01:49:04,567 --> 01:49:07,110
- So what?
- Can't we come to some agreement?

1377
01:49:07,195 --> 01:49:09,613
- Not until he signs!
- I sign nothing!

1378
01:49:09,697 --> 01:49:11,782
Your Excellency,
I must speak to you alone.

1379
01:49:11,866 --> 01:49:13,617
- Do you mind?
- Mind? I don't mind!

1380
01:49:13,701 --> 01:49:15,952
- What is it?
- Sign. Sign.

1381
01:49:16,037 --> 01:49:17,579
Why should he have the advantage?

1382
01:49:17,663 --> 01:49:19,664
What does it matter,
a mere scrap of paper?

1383
01:49:19,749 --> 01:49:21,666
The moment you sign,
he'll take his troops off the border.

1384
01:49:21,751 --> 01:49:23,794
We can move in without losing a man.

1385
01:49:25,213 --> 01:49:26,546
I'll sign.

1386
01:49:26,631 --> 01:49:28,715
What?
Hold this!

1387
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,051
Ah, my little Hynkie!

1388
01:49:31,135 --> 01:49:34,721
My dictator brother!
I knew we have no trouble!

1389
01:49:40,478 --> 01:49:43,897
Two prisoners escaped in officers' uniforms!
Officers tied up in the guard room!

1390
01:49:44,649 --> 01:49:46,983
Sound the alarm!
Two prisoners escaped! Come on!

1391
01:50:05,503 --> 01:50:07,337
The planes are searching for us.

1392
01:50:07,422 --> 01:50:08,755
Let's make for the woods.

1393
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,508
No. We must keep in the open.
The border's that way.

1394
01:50:13,261 --> 01:50:15,345
The invasion of Osterlich.

1395
01:50:16,597 --> 01:50:19,182
Now... or never.

1396
01:50:24,981 --> 01:50:26,314
Ducks!

1397
01:50:31,279 --> 01:50:33,029
Did you hear that?

1398
01:50:33,114 --> 01:50:35,240
Came from over there. Come on.

1399
01:50:46,210 --> 01:50:47,586
<i>Da Blitzen!</i>

1400
01:50:50,590 --> 01:50:52,090
Cheese and crackers!

1401
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:56,261
<i>...da Blitzen!</i>

1402
01:50:57,138 --> 01:50:59,931
A yodeler, huh?
Where'd you get that outfit?

1403
01:51:00,016 --> 01:51:01,725
- What?
- Don't answer back!

1404
01:51:04,187 --> 01:51:07,230
Where's your partner? Where's Schultz?
You won't talk, huh?

1405
01:51:07,315 --> 01:51:10,150
- He'll talk when he gets into camp!
- Come on!

1406
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:15,906
There it is -
the village of Pretzelberg.

1407
01:51:15,990 --> 01:51:17,657
Pretzelberg.

1408
01:51:17,742 --> 01:51:20,577
If we can pass through there,
we're safe across the Osterlich border.

1409
01:51:20,661 --> 01:51:22,579
- Couldn't we go through the woods?
- Of course not.

1410
01:51:22,663 --> 01:51:25,332
The woods are swarming with soldiers.
They'd suspect us at once.

1411
01:51:25,416 --> 01:51:28,960
We must face the music.
If you see anyone, don't look right or left.

1412
01:51:29,045 --> 01:51:31,755
We must bluff our way through.
Remember, you're a storm trooper.

1413
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:34,090
Here they come.

1414
01:51:42,767 --> 01:51:44,559
Can you see what they're doing?

1415
01:51:47,688 --> 01:51:50,232
- They're looking this way.
- Well, pay no attention. Keep going.

1416
01:51:53,361 --> 01:51:56,279
They're beginning to follow us.
Shall we run?

1417
01:51:56,364 --> 01:51:57,864
Certainly not.

1418
01:51:57,949 --> 01:52:00,116
- Just a little bit?
- Keep walking.

1419
01:52:02,453 --> 01:52:05,205
We could walk a little faster.

1420
01:52:05,289 --> 01:52:07,624
Hmm? Make up your mind.

1421
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:20,971
- Perhaps we'd better slow down.
- No, no. Keep going.

1422
01:52:21,055 --> 01:52:22,722
- There's no hurry.
- Come on.

1423
01:52:26,394 --> 01:52:27,561
- What is it?
- He's here!

1424
01:52:27,645 --> 01:52:30,230
What? Bugler! Sound assembly!

1425
01:52:39,991 --> 01:52:43,159
Company! Attention!

1426
01:52:44,245 --> 01:52:46,746
Present... arms!

1427
01:52:50,418 --> 01:52:53,628
- You don't want to change your mind and turn back?
- No, keep going. Keep going.

1428
01:52:55,006 --> 01:52:57,507
- Hail Hynkel.
- Order... arms!

1429
01:52:59,343 --> 01:53:02,178
Your Excellency will be pleased to know
that everything is under control.

1430
01:53:02,263 --> 01:53:03,930
- Good.
- Good.

1431
01:53:04,015 --> 01:53:07,434
I have been in continued communication
with Marshal Herring in Osterlich, sir.

1432
01:53:07,518 --> 01:53:09,519
The route ahead of us is well-guarded.

1433
01:53:09,604 --> 01:53:13,273
And at the back of us are 200 tanks,
50 armored cars and 500 machine guns.

1434
01:53:13,357 --> 01:53:15,191
- Is that -
- Good.

1435
01:53:15,276 --> 01:53:17,694
- Good.
- Are we ready to start?

1436
01:53:17,778 --> 01:53:19,029
- Yes.
- Yes.

1437
01:53:20,281 --> 01:53:21,656
Gentlemen.

1438
01:53:28,205 --> 01:53:30,874
Schultz, I'm certainly happy
to see you with us again.

1439
01:53:30,958 --> 01:53:32,292
Thank you.

1440
01:53:39,383 --> 01:53:42,510
- Where are we going?
- You're invading Osterlich.

1441
01:54:55,793 --> 01:54:58,628
Mr. Jaeckel! Mr. Jaeckel!

1442
01:54:58,713 --> 01:55:01,798
- Hannah!
- Mr. Jaeckel, look, they're coming!

1443
01:55:46,302 --> 01:55:48,178
Present... arms!

1444
01:55:49,597 --> 01:55:51,598
Hail Hynkel!

1445
01:55:51,682 --> 01:55:53,933
Hail Hynkel!

1446
01:55:54,018 --> 01:55:56,227
Present... arms!

1447
01:55:57,938 --> 01:56:01,274
Your Excellency,
the world awaits your word.

1448
01:56:34,183 --> 01:56:36,226
What's happened to him?
He looks strange.

1449
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:38,186
And what's Schultz doing here?

1450
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:39,604
Pardoned, I suppose.

1451
01:56:51,826 --> 01:57:04,754
Here.

1452
01:57:06,882 --> 01:57:09,175
His Excellency, Herr Garbitsch...

1453
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:12,637
Secretary of the Interior,
Minister of Propaganda.

1454
01:57:17,476 --> 01:57:19,519
<i>"Corona veniet delectis. "</i>

1455
01:57:19,603 --> 01:57:21,813
"Victory shall come to the worthy. "

1456
01:57:22,690 --> 01:57:27,902
Today, democracy, liberty and equality
are words to fool the people.

1457
01:57:27,987 --> 01:57:30,697
No nation can progress
with such ideas.

1458
01:57:30,781 --> 01:57:32,365
They stand in the way of action.

1459
01:57:32,449 --> 01:57:34,367
Therefore, we frankly abolish them.

1460
01:57:35,369 --> 01:57:40,039
In the future, each man will serve the interest
of the state with absolute obedience.

1461
01:57:40,124 --> 01:57:42,166
Let him who refuses beware.

1462
01:57:42,251 --> 01:57:46,629
The rights of citizenship will be taken away
from all Jews and other non-Aryans.

1463
01:57:46,714 --> 01:57:50,049
They are inferior,
and therefore enemies of the state.

1464
01:57:50,134 --> 01:57:53,553
It is the duty of all true Aryans
to hate and despise them.

1465
01:57:54,763 --> 01:57:57,807
Henceforth, this nation is annexed
to the Tomainian Empire...

1466
01:57:57,892 --> 01:58:01,686
and the people of this nation will obey
the laws bestowed upon us by our great leader...

1467
01:58:03,063 --> 01:58:07,233
the dictator of Tomainia,
the conqueror of Osterlich...

1468
01:58:07,318 --> 01:58:11,195
the future emperor of the world.

1469
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:13,948
You must speak.

1470
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:16,409
I can't.

1471
01:58:16,493 --> 01:58:19,078
You must. It's our only hope.

1472
01:58:21,874 --> 01:58:23,207
Hope.

1473
01:59:11,048 --> 01:59:12,632
I'm sorry...

1474
01:59:12,716 --> 01:59:14,634
but I don't want to be an emperor.

1475
01:59:14,718 --> 01:59:16,803
That's not my business.

1476
01:59:16,887 --> 01:59:19,389
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone.

1477
01:59:19,473 --> 01:59:21,391
I should like to help everyone,
if possible -

1478
01:59:21,475 --> 01:59:24,727
Jew, gentile, black man, white.

1479
01:59:24,812 --> 01:59:28,398
We all want to help one another.
Human beings are like that.

1480
01:59:28,482 --> 01:59:31,734
We want to live by each other's happiness,
not by each other's misery.

1481
01:59:31,819 --> 01:59:34,237
We don't want to hate and despise
one another.

1482
01:59:34,321 --> 01:59:37,490
In this world, there's room for everyone,
and the good earth is rich...

1483
01:59:37,574 --> 01:59:39,492
and can provide for everyone.

1484
01:59:39,576 --> 01:59:42,620
The way of life can be free and beautiful.

1485
01:59:42,705 --> 01:59:44,747
But we have lost the way.

1486
01:59:44,832 --> 01:59:47,375
Greed has poisoned men's souls...

1487
01:59:47,459 --> 01:59:49,752
has barricaded the world with hate...

1488
01:59:49,837 --> 01:59:52,755
has goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed.

1489
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:56,217
We have developed speed,
but we have shut ourselves in.

1490
01:59:56,301 --> 01:59:59,345
Machinery that gives abundance
has left us in want.

1491
01:59:59,430 --> 02:00:03,349
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.

1492
02:00:03,434 --> 02:00:06,269
We think too much and feel too little.

1493
02:00:06,353 --> 02:00:08,938
More than machinery,
we need humanity.

1494
02:00:09,023 --> 02:00:12,608
More than cleverness,
we need kindness and gentleness.

1495
02:00:12,693 --> 02:00:16,946
Without these qualities, life will be violent,
and all will be lost.

1496
02:00:17,031 --> 02:00:19,741
The aeroplane and the radio
have brought us closer together.

1497
02:00:19,825 --> 02:00:23,036
These very nature of these inventions
cries out for the goodness in men...

1498
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:26,539
cries out for universal brotherhood,
for the unity of us all.

1499
02:00:26,623 --> 02:00:29,625
Even now, my voice is reaching
millions throughout the world...

1500
02:00:29,710 --> 02:00:32,920
millions of despairing men,
women and little children...

1501
02:00:33,005 --> 02:00:38,009
victims of a system that makes men torture
and imprison innocent people.

1502
02:00:38,093 --> 02:00:41,471
To those who can hear me I say,
do not despair.

1503
02:00:41,555 --> 02:00:44,724
The misery that is now upon us
is but the passing of greed...

1504
02:00:44,808 --> 02:00:48,561
the bitterness of men who fear
the way of human progress.

1505
02:00:48,645 --> 02:00:51,939
The hate of men will pass,
and dictators die...

1506
02:00:52,024 --> 02:00:55,568
and the power they took from the people
will return to the people.

1507
02:00:55,652 --> 02:00:59,447
And so long as men die,
liberty will never perish.

1508
02:01:00,824 --> 02:01:03,493
Soldiers,
don't give yourselves to brutes...

1509
02:01:03,577 --> 02:01:07,246
men who despise you, enslave you,
who regiment your lives...

1510
02:01:07,331 --> 02:01:09,582
tell you what to do,
what to think and what to feel...

1511
02:01:09,666 --> 02:01:14,003
who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle,
use you as cannon fodder!

1512
02:01:14,088 --> 02:01:16,672
Don't give yourselves
to these unnatural men -

1513
02:01:16,757 --> 02:01:20,343
machine men with machine minds
and machine hearts!

1514
02:01:20,427 --> 02:01:24,180
You are not machines!
You are not cattle! You are men!

1515
02:01:24,264 --> 02:01:26,516
You have the love of humanity
in your hearts.

1516
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:28,935
You don't hate.
Only the unloved hate.

1517
02:01:29,019 --> 02:01:30,937
The unloved and the unnatural.

1518
02:01:31,021 --> 02:01:34,524
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery,
fight for liberty!

1519
02:01:34,608 --> 02:01:36,651
In the 17th chapter of Saint Luke
it is written...

1520
02:01:36,735 --> 02:01:38,361
"The kingdom of God is within man. "

1521
02:01:38,445 --> 02:01:42,031
Not one man nor a group of men,
but in all men - in you!

1522
02:01:42,116 --> 02:01:44,158
You the people have the power -

1523
02:01:44,243 --> 02:01:47,245
the power to create machines,
the power to create happiness!

1524
02:01:47,329 --> 02:01:50,873
You the people have the power
to make this life free and beautiful...

1525
02:01:50,958 --> 02:01:53,209
to make this life a wonderful adventure.

1526
02:01:53,293 --> 02:01:56,462
Then, in the name of democracy,
let us use that power!

1527
02:01:56,547 --> 02:01:58,131
Let us all unite!

1528
02:01:58,215 --> 02:02:01,634
Let us fight for a new world,
a decent world...

1529
02:02:01,718 --> 02:02:03,469
that will give men a chance to work...

1530
02:02:03,554 --> 02:02:06,556
that will give youth a future
and old age a security.

1531
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:09,600
By the promise of these things,
brutes have risen to power.

1532
02:02:09,685 --> 02:02:13,563
But they lie. They do not fulfill that promise.
They never will!

1533
02:02:13,647 --> 02:02:17,400
Dictators free themselves,
but they enslave the people.

1534
02:02:17,484 --> 02:02:20,570
Now let us fight to fulfill that promise!

1535
02:02:20,654 --> 02:02:22,905
Let us fight to free the world...

1536
02:02:22,990 --> 02:02:26,576
to do away with national barriers,
to do away with greed...

1537
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:28,661
with hate and intolerance.

1538
02:02:28,745 --> 02:02:33,332
Let us fight for a world of reason,
a world where science and progress...

1539
02:02:33,417 --> 02:02:35,751
will lead to all men's happiness.

1540
02:02:35,836 --> 02:02:40,173
Soldiers, in the name of democracy,
let us all unite!

1541
02:03:05,282 --> 02:03:06,574
Hannah...

1542
02:03:07,534 --> 02:03:09,035
can you hear me?

1543
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:13,706
<i>Wherever you are, look up, Hannah.</i>

1544
02:03:14,541 --> 02:03:16,792
<i>The clouds are lifting.</i>

1545
02:03:16,877 --> 02:03:18,878
<i>The sun is breaking through.</i>

1546
02:03:19,379 --> 02:03:22,882
<i>We are coming out of the darkness
and into the light.</i>

1547
02:03:22,966 --> 02:03:27,303
<i>We are coming into a new world,
a kindlier world...</i>

1548
02:03:27,387 --> 02:03:29,639
<i>where men will rise above their hate...</i>

1549
02:03:29,723 --> 02:03:32,391
<i>their greed and brutality.</i>

1550
02:03:33,393 --> 02:03:35,061
<i>Look up, Hannah.</i>

1551
02:03:35,145 --> 02:03:37,730
<i>The soul of man has been given wings...</i>

1552
02:03:37,814 --> 02:03:40,816
<i>and at last he is beginning to fly.</i>

1553
02:03:40,901 --> 02:03:43,152
<i>He is flying into the rainbow...</i>

1554
02:03:43,237 --> 02:03:46,656
<i>into the light of hope,
into the future -</i>

1555
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:48,824
<i>the glorious future...</i>

1556
02:03:48,909 --> 02:03:51,827
<i>that belongs to you, to me...</i>

1557
02:03:51,912 --> 02:03:53,746
<i>and to all of us.</i>

1558
02:03:53,830 --> 02:03:56,540
<i>Look up, Hannah. Look up.</i>

1559
02:04:21,692 --> 02:04:24,860
Hannah, did you hear that?

1560
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:28,364
Listen.
