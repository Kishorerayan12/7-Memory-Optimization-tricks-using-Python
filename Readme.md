# 7 Python Memory Optimization Tricks To Enhance Your Code's Efficiency
  This article discusses the limitations of Python as a programming language, but offers 7 effective memory optimization tricks to improve Python programming skills. By mastering these tricks, you can optimize the memory usage of Python programs effectively.

## 1.Use __slots__ in Classes Definitions
Python offers more flexibility in OOP, such as adding extra attributes and methods at runtime. However, this flexibility can waste memory due to the need for a special dictionary (__dict__) to store instance variables. To avoid this, Python provides a magical attribute called __slots__, which works as a whitelist by specifying the names of all valid attributes of a class. This allows Python to allocate the necessary memory space for the attributes defined in __slots__. A comparison program demonstrates that using __slots__ in class definitions saves memory resources compared to the me instance, which has to keep an extra dictionary. Overall, Python's dynamic typing language offers a more efficient way to define classes and attributes.

## 2.Use Generators
Generators in Python are lazy-evaluating versions of lists that generate items when the next() method is called, making them memory-efficient for large datasets. They work like an element-generating factory, generating items only when the next() method is called. Comparing generators and lists can help determine which one is more memory-efficient. Converting square brackets into parentheses can also simplify defining generator expressions in Python.

## 3.Leverage Memory-Mapped File Support for Large File Processing
Memory-mapped file I/O (mmap) is an OS-level optimization that implements demand paging, saving memory by creating a mapping of the file directly in the virtual memory space of the current process. Python provides a built-in module for using this technique, making it easy to leverage without considering OS-level implementations. To use mmap for file handling in Python, simply apply the mmap.mmap() method and handle the opened object using standard file methods or slicing notations.

## 4.Minimize the Use of Global Variables
Global variables stay in memory for as long as a program runs since they have global scope.Therefore, if a global variable holds a large data structure, it occupies memory throughout the program's lifecycle, potentially leading to inefficient memory use. We should minimize the usage of global variables in our Python code.

## 5.Leverage Short-Circuit Evaluation of Logical Operators
Short-circuit evaluation of logical operators can significantly reduce memory usage in programs. For instance, a code snippet that executes two memory-inefficient functions can be simplified to use the short-circuit evaluation rule, resulting in a more efficient result. This approach saves memory.

## 6.Choose Data Types Carefully
A senior Python developer should choose data types carefully to ensure they are more memory-efficient. Tuples are more memory-efficient than lists due to their immutability, allowing for optimizations in memory allocation. Arrays are more memory-efficient because they require all elements to be of the same data type, while lists can store different types of objects, requiring more memory. Excellent data science modules like NumPy and Pandas provide more data types, making them more efficient for complex matrix manipulations. While Python's built-in array may be suitable for simple one-dimensional arrays, NumPy's array is the best choice for data scientists.

## 7.Apply String Interning Technique To Identical Strings
The code demonstrates the use of the string interning technique in Python, which allows Python to implicitly intern small-size strings with the same values. This technique optimizes memory usage by referring to the same object in memory. However, the code demonstrates that the is operator is used to check if two variables refer to the same object, while the == operator compares if two objects have the same value. This technique can also be applied to small integers for memory optimization.
